record of a past summer may recall some pleasant recollections to those
who have already visited the sunny lands she attempts to describe; and
that her accounts, though they inadequately express the beauty and
charm of these distant countries, may interest those who prefer
travelling for half-an-hour when seated in their arm-chairs.

<h2 class="super">TURKISH HAREMS AND CIRCASSIAN HOMES.</h2>
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CITY OF THE SUN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was on a sunny summer morning that an English
schooner yacht, that had been tossing about all night on the stormy
waves of the Sea of Marmora, rounded the point opposite Scutari, and,
gracefully spreading her wings like a white bird, came rapidly on under
the influence of the fresh morning breeze, and cast anchor at the
entrance of the Golden Horn.</p>
<p class="par">The rattle of the chain had scarcely ceased when up came
all the poor sea-sick folk from below, for yachting people can be
sea-sick sometimes, whatever may be the popular belief to the contrary.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Never, perhaps, was a greater Babel of tongues heard on
board any little vessel. The owner of the yacht, his wife and sister,
were English; but there was an Italian governess, a French maid, a
German bonne, a Neapolitan captain, a Maltese mate, two children
speaking indifferently well most of these languages, and a crew
comprising every nation bordering the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="par">(This little explanation has been given in excuse for
the desultory nature of the few pages that are offered, with much
diffidence, to a kind public, as they consist principally of extracts
from the journals and letters of the various dwellers on board the
<i>Claymore</i>.)</p>
<p class="par">Besides these many tongues that were pouring forth
expressions of joy and admiration with a vehemence of gesticulation and
an energy of tone unknown in northern lands, two canaries, gifted with
the most vigorous lungs and the most indefatigable throats, lifted up
their shrill voices to add to the general clamour.</p>
<p class="par">All this uproar, however, was but to express the delight
every one felt at the unequalled beauty of the scene before them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<span lang="it">Veder Napoli, e poi
morir!</span>&rdquo; is a well-known saying. Put Constantinople instead
of Naples, and the flattering words are equally applicable.</p>
<p class="par">Constantinople has been so often written about that it
is useless to describe its lovely aspect in detail. Every one knows
that there are minarets and towers rising up, in fairy-like grace, from
amid gardens and cypress groves; but &ldquo;he who would see it
aright&rdquo; should have his first view in all the bright unreality of
a sunny summer morning. Soon after dawn, in the tender duskiness of the
early hours, when the light steals down shyly from the veiled east, and
before the business and noise of a great city begin, Constantinople is
like the sleeping beauty in the wood. A great hush is over everything,
broken only when the sun comes up in a blaze of light, flooding sea,
earth, and city with a &ldquo;glory&rdquo; of life and colour.</p>
<p class="par">Then from each minaret is heard the voice of the
muezzins, as they summon the faithful to prayers. The fairy-like
ca&iuml;ques skim in every direction across the waters; and the
beautifully-named but dirty and somewhat ugly Golden Horn is all astir
with moving vessels. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"
name="pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Nearly opposite the yacht was a very handsome building
of white Greek marble, with an immense frontage to the sea. This is the
Sultan&rsquo;s palace of Dolm&eacute;-Batch&eacute;. The wing on the
right, where the windows are closely barred and jealously latticed,
contains the apartments of the ladies of the Imperial harem.</p>
<p class="par">Behind the palace, stretching up the hill and crowning
its summit, are seen the white, handsome houses that form the
fashionable suburb of Pera. Here ambassadors and bankers have large,
comfortable hotels; here, too, are the European shops, and the
promenade for the Christian world. But the part to see&mdash;the part
that interests&mdash;is, of course, the old Turkish quarter, Stamboul;
for in Stamboul are Turks in turbans, and in Stamboul are real Turkish
houses.</p>
<p class="par">More tumble-down places it would be difficult to find. A
man had need to be a fatalist to live in a house of which all the four
walls lean at different angles. A fire, instead of a misfortune, must
be a real blessing, were it only to bring some air into the dirty,
narrow, ill-savoured streets.</p>
<p class="par">The dirt, the narrowness, and the wretchedly bad
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>pavement, combined with another trouble, the
multitude of dogs lying about, make walking, pain and grief to the
newly-arrived foreigner.</p>
<p class="par">Besides these disagreeables, there is the danger of
being crushed flat against a wall by human beasts of burden called
&ldquo;hamals&rdquo; or porters. It is really frightful to see men so
laden.</p>
<p class="par">As they come staggering along, bent double beneath their
loads, at every few steps they utter a loud cry, to warn passers-by to
get out of their way. It is, however, by no means an easy matter to
avoid them. The streets are so narrow and tortuous that, after jumping
hastily aside to escape one monstrous package coming up the road, the
unhappy stranger is nearly knocked over by another huge load coming
down. Dogs&rsquo; tails, too, are always lying where dogs&rsquo; tails
should not be; and in the agitation and anxiety caused by incessantly
darting from side to side of the street to avoid the groaning
&ldquo;hamals,&rdquo; it is exceedingly difficult to avoid treading
occasionally on one of these inconvenient tails, and then the whole
quarter resounds with hideous howlings.</p>
<p class="par">The bazaars have been so well and so fully described
that it is needless to say much about them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>Our first
sensation on seeing them was, perhaps, that of a little disappointment;
but after a time we better appreciated the picturesque beauty and
richness of colouring that the long dark lanes of little shops
presented.</p>
<p class="par">As a rule, few pretty things, excepting shoes and
slippers, are exposed on the stalls. Rugs, carpets, shawls, and jewels
are generally kept behind the shops in cupboards and warehouses.</p>
<p class="par">Turquoises were very abundant and low in price, but all
we saw were of inferior quality, and the large stones had some flaw.
Pretty melon-shaped caskets are made in silver to hold cakes, and the
silver rose-water bottles are charming both in design and workmanship.
Foreigners are speedily attracted to the drug bazaar by the odd mixture
of pungent, pleasant, and disagreeable odours that proceed from it.
Here the scene is like a living picture of the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights&rsquo; Tales.&rdquo; Like Amine in the story of &ldquo;The Three
Calenders,&rdquo; many a veiled figure attended by her black slave may
be seen making her purchases of drugs and spices of the venerable old
doctors, who, with spectacles on nose, and huge musty folios at their
side, look the very personification <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7"
href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>of wisdom, equally able to
administer medicines and to draw the horoscopes of their patients.</p>
<p class="par">The arms bazaar is also attractive, not only for the
magnificence and value of its contents, but from the picturesque beauty
of the quaint, dark, lofty old building in which the richly-decorated
weapons are displayed.</p>
<p class="par">At first, the immense amount of bargaining that is
required before any purchase can be effected is very amusing; but after
some weeks it becomes tiresome, even to people who have had many
years&rsquo; experience in Italy.</p>
<p class="par">If anything of importance has to be bought, many hours,
sometimes many days, elapse between the opening of the business and its
conclusion.</p>
<p class="par">The friends of both parties cordially assist in the
affair with the utmost force of their lungs, and an amount of falsehood
is told by Christians as well as Turks that ought to lie heavily on the
consciences of all; but &ldquo;do in Turkey as the Turks do,&rdquo; is
a maxim which all appear to accept, and so no one dreams of speaking
the truth in a Constantinople bazaar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When the struggle is at its height, coffee is brought,
which materially recruits the strength of all concerned, and should the
affair be very important, a friendly pipe is smoked; then everyone sets
to work again, vowing, protesting, denying. The seller asserts by all
that is holy that he will lose money, but that such is the love he
feels for the stranger and the Frank, that he will sell the article to
him for such and such a price (probably four times as much as the sum
he means to take), and at length, after an exhausting afternoon, the
foreigner retires triumphant, bearing away with him the coveted shawls
or carpets, and not having paid perhaps more than double the money they
are worth.</p>
<p class="par">As we remained on the Bosphorus for a considerable part
of the summer, we were enabled not only to see at our ease the many
objects of interest to be found in Constantinople and the lovely
country that surrounds it, but also to gratify the great wish we had of
becoming somewhat acquainted with Turkish life, and of learning
something of the realities of Turkish homes.</p>
<p class="par">Every year it is more difficult for passing travellers
to gain admittance to the harems. Of course <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>the members
of the principal families object to be made a show of, and equally of
course the wives of the diplomatists residing in Constantinople are
unwilling to intrude too frequently upon the privacy of these ladies. A
Turkish visit also entails a somewhat serious loss of time, as it
generally lasts from mid-day to sunset.</p>
<p class="par">When royal and other very great ladies arrive at
Constantinople, certain grand f&ecirc;tes are given to them in
different official houses, but these magnificent breakfasts and dinners
do not give Europeans a better knowledge of Turkish homes than a dinner
or ball at Buckingham Palace or the Tuileries would give a Turk
respecting the nature of domestic life in England or France.</p>
<p class="par">The wives of several diplomats had given us letters of
introduction to many of their friends at Constantinople, and so kindly
were these responded to by the Turkish ladies that we found ourselves
received at once with the greatest cordiality, and before we left the
shores of the Bosphorus had made friendships that we heartily trust we
may be fortunate enough to renew at some future day.</p>
<p class="par">After a stay of several months, our conviction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>was that it would be difficult to find people more
kind-hearted, more simple-mannered, or more sweet-tempered than the
Turkish women.</p>
<p class="par">The servants, or slaves, are treated with a kindness and
consideration that many Christian households would do well to imitate.
They seem quite part of the family, and in fact a woman slave does
belong to it should she have a child, as she then is entitled to her
freedom, and her master is bound to accord her certain privileges which
give her a position higher than that of a servant, though she does not
attain the dignity of being a wife.</p>
<p class="par">The greatest punishment we have heard of, and which is
only inflicted on viragos whose tongues set the whole harem in a flame,
is to <i>sell</i> (or what is still worse) to <i>give</i> them away to
a family of inferior rank.</p>
<p class="par">This is considered a frightful indignity, and one which,
when seriously threatened, usually suffices to still the veriest
shrew.</p>
<p class="par">Of course a jealous and perhaps neglected wife may
occasionally make a pretty young odalisk&rsquo;s life somewhat
uncomfortable, but harsh usage and cruelty are almost unknown; and in
general the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>wife (for now there is seldom more than one) is
quite satisfied if her authority is upheld, and if she remain the
supreme head of the household. If content on these matters, she rarely
troubles herself about the amusements of her husband.</p>
<p class="par">A Turkish woman also rapidly becomes old, and after a
few years of youth finds her principal happiness in the care of her
children, in eating, in the gossip at the bath, and in the weekly drive
to the Valley of the Sweet Waters.</p>
<p class="par">A Turkish wife, whatever her rank, is always at home at
sunset to receive her husband, and to present him with his pipe and
slippers when, his daily work over, he comes to enjoy the repose of his
harem.</p>
<p class="par">In most households also the wife superintends her
husband&rsquo;s dinner, and has the entire control over all domestic
affairs.</p>
<p class="par">The greatest charm of the Turkish ladies consists in the
perfect simplicity of their manners, and in the total absence of all
pretence.</p>
<p class="par">When we knew them better, the childlike frankness with
which they talked was both amusing and pleasant; but many of them
nevertheless were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>shrewd and intelligent, and had they received
anything like adequate education, would have been able to compete with
some of the most talented of their European sisters.</p>
<p class="par">As mothers, their tenderness is unequalled, but their
fault here is over-indulgence of the children, who, until ten or twelve
years of age, are permitted to do everything they like.</p>
<p class="par">Many of the ladies whose acquaintance we made showed a
remarkably quick ear, and great facility in learning various songs and
pieces of music that we gave them. Their voices were sweet and
melodious, and it was surprising with what rapidity they caught the
Italian and Neapolitan airs that they heard us sing.</p>
<p class="par">The great bar to any real progress being made towards
their due education, and the enlargement of their minds, is the
seclusion in which they live.</p>
<p class="par">Men and women are evidently not intended to live
socially apart, for each deteriorates by the separation. Men who live
only with other men become rough, selfish, and coarse; whilst women,
when entirely limited to the conversation of their own sex, grow
indolent, narrow-minded, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>scandal-loving. Like flint and steel,
the brilliant spark only comes forth when the necessary amount of
friction has been applied.</p>
<p class="par">Whatever degree of intimacy may be attained, it is rare
that foreigners obtain a knowledge of more than the surface of Turkish
life and manners. Strangers, therefore, should speak with much caution
and reserve; but still, even a casual observer must perceive that
polygamy and the singular laws regarding succession are productive of
innumerable evils amongst the Turks.</p>
<p class="par">The men, it is said, have but little, if any, love for
their offspring. Not only do they dislike the expense of bringing up
children, but fathers dread having sons who in time may become their
most dangerous enemies.</p>
<p class="par">In quiet families who live apart from public life the
boys have a better chance of being spared. In families of very high
rank but few are to be seen, whilst in the households of the relatives
of the Sultan they are still more rare.</p>
<p class="par">Infanticide, therefore, prevails extensively; it is
hinted at without scruple; in fact, the Turks, both men and women, do
not hesitate to express their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>surprise that Europeans encumber
themselves with large families.</p>
<p class="par">In the Imperial House, the throne descends in succession
to each son of a deceased Sultan before any grandson can inherit. This
regulation was made in order that the monarch should be the nearest
living relative of the Prophet.</p>
<p class="par">In olden times, therefore, the first act of a Sultan on
ascending the throne was to get rid of all his brothers by imprisonment
or death, not only for the purpose of securing the crown for his own
children, but to prevent the risk that might accrue to himself by there
being a grown-up successor ready to usurp his place.</p>
<p class="par">Personal merit used to be a matter of comparative
indifference to the Turks, provided the Sultan were a member of the
great imperial family. Occasionally therefore monarchs, who had reason
to believe themselves much hated by their subjects, have not hesitated
to sacrifice their own offspring to their fears.</p>
<p class="par">The late Sultan, Abd-ul-Medjid, was thought a wonder of
liberality because he permitted his brother, the present Sultan, to
live. But Abd-ul-Medjid&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>heart had been softened by a
sorrow he had had in early life. Shortly before he came to the throne
he had a favourite odalisk, to whom he was much attached. In those days
none of the royal princes were permitted to become fathers, and the
poor girl fell a sacrifice to the State policy which forbade her
becoming the mother of a living child. Within a week of her death
Sultan Mahmoud died, and his son ascended the throne. Had the odalisk
lived and had a son, she would have enjoyed the rank of first
&ldquo;Kadun&rdquo; to the reigning monarch.</p>
<p class="par">The Sultan&rsquo;s rank is so elevated&mdash;his
position is so far above that of every other mortal&mdash;that there is
no woman on earth sufficiently his equal to enable him to marry her. He
has, therefore, no legal wife, but his ladies are called
&ldquo;Kaduns,&rdquo; or companions, and the mother of his eldest son
is always chief kadun, a position that gives her many advantages. These
ladies are not called sultanas, for only the princesses of the
blood-royal enjoy that title, but the mother of the reigning sovereign
is named Sultan-Valid&eacute;.</p>
<p class="par">Occasionally, when there is a subject whom the Sultan
wishes especially to honour, the favoured <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>pasha has one of the
monarch&rsquo;s daughters or sisters given to him in marriage; but this
great distinction is sometimes the cause of much sorrow, and uproots
much domestic happiness, as all other wives must be sent away, and the
children of such marriages equally banished, before the royal bride
will condescend to enter the pasha&rsquo;s harem. Even after marriage,
the royal lady will sometimes insist upon retaining all the privileges
of her rank, and in that case the husband becomes the veriest slave
imaginable, never daring to enter the harem unless summoned by the
princess, and when there often obliged to remain standing while
receiving the orders of his imperial and imperious wife.
F&mdash;&mdash; Pasha, though his ambition was gratified by becoming
the brother-in-law of the Sultan, paid somewhat dearly, if reports be
true, for the honour of this royal alliance, as the princess was said
to be a lady of uncertain temper, or rather of a very certain temper,
as Charles Dickens described it. At any rate F&mdash;&mdash;
Pasha&rsquo;s heart clung to the forsaken wife and children of his
humbler and perhaps happier days; and sometimes in the dusk of the
evening a small, undecorated ca&iuml;que, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>containing a man closely
muffled up, might be seen darting swiftly across the Bosphorus from the
palace of the lordly pasha to the remote quarter of Scutari, where, in
a humble house in a back street, were hid away the poor deserted wife
and her little children.</p>
<p class="par">All, therefore, is not gold that glitters in the lives
of the members of the imperial family, and the State policy that
ordains there shall not be too many heirs near the throne often wrings
the heart and embitters the existence of many of the tender-hearted
princesses.</p>
<p class="par">Although the men probably accept the necessities of this
policy with comparative indifference, the mothers do not so easily
resign themselves to the loss of their infants, and many a sad story
gets whispered about of the grievous struggles some of the poor
creatures have made to preserve their little ones from the impending
doom.</p>
<p class="par">The death of one royal lady that took place while we
were at Constantinople, was hastened by the grief she had gone through
by thus losing her only boy.</p>
<p class="par">When her marriage took place, she had obtained the
promise that all her children were to be spared. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>In due
time a boy was born, and the father received an intimation that the
child had better &ldquo;cease to be.&rdquo; The Sultana, however,
claimed the fulfilment of the promise that had been made her, and
watched and guarded the little fellow most rigorously.</p>
<p class="par">The Sultan&rsquo;s word being inviolable, it was not
possible to break it openly, but the mother was aware of the jealousy
that was created by the privilege accorded to her, and knew that the
child&rsquo;s life was in constant peril. It is said that attempts were
made both to poison and to drown him, but these cruel designs were
frustrated by the vigilance of his mother, who never suffered the child
to be absent from her.</p>
<p class="par">When the boy was between two and three years old, two
more of the Sultan&rsquo;s daughters married, and many magnificent
f&ecirc;tes were given on the occasion. The elder sister was of course
present, accompanied as usual by her little son; but one day in the
crowd the child disappeared, and has never since been heard of.</p>
<p class="par">Although the poor mother had another child, a girl, she
never held up her head again after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>disappearance of her boy,
and actually pined away and died from grief at his loss.</p>
<p class="par">This is not a solitary instance of the sorrows of royal
Turkish ladies.</p>
<p class="par">As we became more intimate with the inhabitants of the
harem, and were able to understand and express ourselves a little
better, our friends made themselves very merry at the expense of some
of our Frank customs. Few of our habits appeared to them more ludicrous
than that of the men so incessantly raising their hats.</p>
<p class="par">When quarrelling, it is a common mode of abuse to say,
&ldquo;May your fatigued and hated soul, when it arrives in purgatory,
find no more rest than a Giaour&rsquo;s hat enjoys on earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Turkish language is rich and euphonious, and is
capable of so much variety of expression that it is remarkably well
adapted to poetry. The verses we occasionally heard recited had a
rhythm that was exceedingly agreeable to the ear.</p>
<p class="par">Though improvements do not march on in Turkey with giant
strides, still progress is being made surely, though slowly; and many
of the Turks, besides being well educated in other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>respects, now speak Italian, English, and French
with much fluency. Some of the ladies, also, are beginning to learn
these languages, although most of them, excepting those very few who
have been abroad, are too shy to venture to speak in a foreign
tongue.</p>
<p class="par">The Sultan&rsquo;s mother&mdash;the
Sultan-Valid&eacute;&mdash;was a very superior woman, and did much good
service towards promoting education. Amongst other of her excellent
deeds, she founded a college for the instruction of young candidates
for public offices.</p>
<p class="par">There are now in Constantinople medical, naval, and
agricultural schools, all well attended, and fairly well looked
after.</p>
<p class="par">For the women, private tuition is of course their only
means of learning, and not only is the supply of governesses very
limited, but their abilities are in general of a very mediocre
description.</p>
<p class="par">Unless in very superior families, a little&mdash;a very
little Arabic, to enable them to read, though not to understand, the
Koran, working, knitting, and perhaps a slight acquaintance with French
and music, is deemed amply sufficient knowledge for daughters to
acquire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE HOUR OF PRAYER.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is much that is both grand and poetical in
many of the practices of the Mohammedan religion; and few things strike
the stranger more than the frequent calls to prayer that resound at
certain hours of the day from every minaret of the city.</p>
<p class="par">The formula used is simple, but heart-stirring:
&ldquo;Allah akbar! Allah akbar! Great God! Great God! There is no God
but God! I declare that Mohammed is the apostle of God! O great
Redeemer! O Ruler of the universe! Great God! Great God! There is no
God but God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This is chanted by the muezzin in a loud but musical
voice as he walks slowly around the minaret, thus summoning from every
portion of the globe the faithful to join him in holy prayer.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At sunrise, at mid-day, at three o&rsquo;clock, and
again at nine, the sacred cry re-echoes above the city, and every true
believer as it reaches his ear prostrates himself with his face towards
Mecca, exclaiming: &ldquo;There is no power, no might, but in God
Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All who can, perform their devotions in the mosques,
although earnest prayer is quite as efficacious when made in a house or
by the road-side.</p>
<p class="par">One Friday, having provided ourselves with the necessary
firman, we repaired to Santa Sophia, and arrived there a few minutes
before the hour of mid-day prayer. Franks are now admitted into the
mosque, but have to put on slippers over their boots, that they may not
defile the exquisite cleanliness of the floor. As the service was about
to begin, we went up to one of the galleries, and from thence had a
good general view of the interior.</p>
<p class="par">Nothing could be more simple. There was as little
decoration as would be found in a low-church Protestant chapel. A few
ostrich eggs and some large candelabra hung from the roof, but all the
Christian paintings and ornaments have been destroyed or defaced. The
figures and the six wings of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>the famous cherubim can still be seen
faintly traced on the dome, but the faces of the angels have been
covered with golden plates, as the Turks interpret very literally the
commandment against idolatry.</p>
<p class="par">Although there was but little to see in the mosque
itself apart from its historical associations, the vast assemblage of
worshippers that nearly filled its spacious area was most interesting
to behold.</p>
<p class="par">Stamboul (in which quarter is Santa Sophia) is now
principally inhabited by old-fashioned Turks, and by large colonies of
Circassians. Many of the worshippers, therefore, wore the flowing robe
and stately turban now nearly banished from the more fashionable parts
of the town. The Circassians also were habited in their picturesque
national costume, and it would be impossible to see anywhere men more
dignified or noble in appearance than these poor exiles.</p>
<p class="par">The service is impressive from its grand simplicity. As
the hour of noon is proclaimed, the Imaun places himself before a small
niche called the Mihrab, that points towards Mecca, and in a loud voice
proclaims, &ldquo;Allah akbar! Allah akbar!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>The
congregation arise, respond with the same words, and the cry seems,
like a mighty wave, to roll backward and forward through the vast
space.</p>
<p class="par">Every man then turns his eyes humbly to the ground as
the Imaun recites the Fatiha or Lord&rsquo;s Prayer:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the name of the most merciful God; praise be
to God the Lord of all creatures, the most merciful, the Lord of the
Day of Judgment. Thee do we worship, and of Thee do we beg help, direct
us in the right way. Direct us in the way of those to whom Thou hast
been gracious; not of those against whom thou art incensed, nor of
those who go astray. Ameen, ameen!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The congregation then prostrate themselves repeatedly in
acknowledgment of the Almighty&rsquo;s power and might. A chapter of
the Koran is read, followed by more prostrations, with another prayer
in which the worshippers join. Then the Imaun calls out in a loud voice
that each man is to make his private prayer, and the solemn silence and
perfect quiet that ensues is most impressive.</p>
<p class="par">Prayers were now over, and those who wished retired. The
remainder approached nearer a small <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25"
href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>pulpit into which another Imaun
mounted, who, seated cross-legged on a cushion, commenced an exposition
of some portion of the Koran.</p>
<p class="par">No women had hitherto been present during the service,
but a few now entered and seated themselves behind the men.</p>
<p class="par">When we walked round the mosque to examine it in detail,
we were shown the mark said to have been made by the hand of Sultan
Mahmoud when he placed it upon one of the great columns in token that
he took possession of the stronghold of the Christian faith. As the
spot indicated, however, is at least fifteen feet from the ground, we
permitted ourselves to doubt the accuracy of the statement.</p>
<p class="par">After leaving Santa Sophia we passed through the largest
square in Constantinople, called Ak&rsquo; Meidan, or the &ldquo;place
of meat.&rdquo; Here it was that the Janissaries were put to death by
the orders of Sultan Mahmoud. This wholesale massacre, fearful as it
was, and cruel as it seemed, nevertheless delivered Turkey from one of
its greatest scourges, for such was the rapacity, the cruelty, and the
overbearing insolence of these famous troops, that no man&rsquo;s life
or property was safe for an hour, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>whole country groaned
under a tyranny more oppressive than any it had ever known.</p>
<p class="par">After Santa Sophia, the finest mosque in Constantinople
is that of Sultan Ahmed. It is a large and handsome building; its six
tall, graceful minarets giving much beauty to the exterior, whilst the
interior is chiefly remarkable for the eleven gigantic columns that
support the roof. The mosque possesses some very fine Korans all richly
bound in velvet, some of them even encrusted with pearls and precious
stones. There is also a magnificent collection of jewelled cups that
have been presented by various sultans and by many rich pashas.</p>
<p class="par">When we issued forth from the cool freshness of the
shady mosque, the burning glare of the sun seemed doubly oppressive. We
were thankful even to climb into the little telega that was awaiting
us; fleas and tight squeezing seeming slight evils compared with the
scorching heat and blinding vividness of the sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>
<p class="par">When we halted at the beautiful fountain of Ahmed the
Third, never did water and marble look more delicious and
refreshing.</p>
<p class="par">This celebrated fountain is one of the most <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>beautiful little buildings in Constantinople. It
is an octagon made of white marble, the projecting roof extending far
beyond the walls. Where gilt lattice-work has not been let into the
sides they are covered with inscriptions in gold letters, extolling the
virtues of the treasure it contains; for the waters of the Fountain of
Ahmed are said to excel in freshness and purity even those of the Holy
Well of the Prophet at Mecca, and have been in many poems compared to
the Sacred Fount whose eternal spring has its rise in Paradise
itself.</p>
<p class="par">On a little marble slab outside the building are
arranged rows of brass cups full of the fresh water so precious to the
hot and weary passenger in Constantinople.</p>
<p class="par">As we lingered in the grateful shade, thankful to
escape, even for a few minutes, from the scorching heat, two poor
hamals came staggering down the street, bent nearly double beneath
their terrible loads. With almost a groan of relief they came beneath
the shelter of the projecting roof, and, dropping their packs, seated
themselves on the fresh, cool marble pavement. It was now three
o&rsquo;clock, and, pouring a few cups of water over their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>hands
and feet, they prostrated themselves towards Mecca, and remained an
instant in silent prayer.</p>
<p class="par">These poor fellows, notwithstanding their galling toil,
are a merry, contented race of people. From dawn to sunset they work
like beasts of burden, and are satisfied with food that would kill an
English workman in a week. Our two neighbours each pulled a very small
bit of black bread from his pocket, got a slice of melon from an
adjacent fruit stall, and this slender fare, washed down by a few cups
of water, made their dinner for the day. The repast, slight as it was,
was eaten with a cheerfulness and satisfaction that might have been
envied by many a gourmand.</p>
<p class="par">At sunset, however, they feel themselves amply repaid
for the fatigues of the day if they can but gain enough to indulge in
an infinite number of cups of the strongest coffee, which, with the
soothing pipe, gives them strength to sustain their prodigious
toil.</p>
<p class="par">One ought to visit the East to appreciate, to its full
extent, the blessing of an abundance of fresh and pure water. No wonder
that the Prophet says that he who bestows the treasure of a fountain on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>his fellow-men shall be sustained by the
supporting hand of the Angel of Mercy as he traverses the perilous
bridge made of a single hair, by which alone the gates of Paradise can
be reached.</p>
<p class="par">Fresh springs of water, also, are doubly dear to the
hearts of the faithful, as by the direct miracle of sending water in
the wilderness was the life of Ishmael saved when Sarai succeeded in
having the child and his mother Hagar banished from the tents of
Abraham.</p>
<p class="par">Wandering far into the recesses of the desert, the small
bottle of water with which she had been provided speedily became empty,
and the sorrowing and forsaken woman found herself in the terrible
wilderness alone, and far from the aid of man. She placed her hapless
infant beneath some shrubs, and, retiring to a distance that she might
not see the little creature die, the unhappy mother lifted up her voice
and wept.</p>
<p class="par">But when was the Almighty deaf to the cry of the
afflicted and oppressed? He hears when men&rsquo;s ears and hearts are
closed; and, swift as thought, the Angel of Compassion, that watches
day and night at the foot of God&rsquo;s throne, sped from his heavenly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>post and touched the barren earth. The faint
flutter of the angel&rsquo;s wings roused the poor mother from her
grief: she turned and beheld, gushing brightly from the rock, the
stream whose crystal waters brought salvation to herself and to her
child.</p>
<p class="par">Although it is the custom to inveigh energetically
against the folly of seeing too many sights at once, yet old travellers
know full well that no town is really enjoyable until all the wonders
of it have been visited.</p>
<p class="par">Then, and not till then, is there rest for mind and
body, as, all necessary sights seen, the traveller can seek again the
especial objects of his fancy, and in peace and ease make more intimate
acquaintance with the scenes of nature, or of art, that have the most
charm for him.</p>
<p class="par">Most people, probably, will acknowledge that the former
have a considerable supremacy over the latter in Constantinople. There
are no picture-galleries, and, excepting some of the mosques, a few
palaces, and the Seraglio, there are few buildings to interest a lover
of architecture.</p>
<p class="par">The Seraglio, however, is well worth a visit, for,
though neither grand, nor beautiful, it is interesting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>in many
ways; and the position it occupies on rising ground at the entrance of
the Golden Horn (thus commanding the Bosphorus both east and west)
makes the views from its gardens quite unequalled in beauty.</p>
<p class="par">The summer was unusually hot, so that it was often quite
an effort to tear ourselves away from the cool rooms and delightful
garden of the Embassy at Therapia, where we were staying, and undertake
a regular afternoon of sight-seeing, especially also as it was
necessary to go to Stamboul, or Pera, in one of the hot little steamers
that ply incessantly up and down the Bosphorus.</p>
<p class="par">One intensely hot day, however, we set off for the
Seraglio, and the thermometer being at any number of degrees, and the
deck of the steamer so crowded that there was barely standing room, we
arrived at the gate of the Palace in a very exhausted state. When we
entered the first court therefore, and found ourselves under the shade
of a gigantic plane-tree, a faint breeze every now and then rustling
amongst the leaves, the change was so pleasant that we thought we would
give up sight seeing, and stay there till night. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Not only was the cool shade very grateful to our
feelings, but the pretty scene before us was very pleasant to the eyes.
Beneath the tree was a small fountain, its stream trickling into a
shallow marble basin, and on its brink were seated groups of
gaily-dressed women, chattering merrily as they ate melon and
sweetmeats.</p>
<p class="par">Having never been in Spain, we are ignorant of the
witching grace bestowed upon the fair or unfair Spaniard by the magic
folds of the mantilla; but not having had that good fortune, we all
agreed that no head-dress is so becoming to the female face as the
Turkish veil, worn as it is arranged at Constantinople.</p>
<p class="par">Great art and much consideration are bestowed upon the
arrangement of the folds; and in this respect a lady of Constantinople
is as much superior to her Eastern compeers as a &ldquo;lionne&rdquo;
in Paris would be above her provincial rivals.</p>
<p class="par">So coquettishly is the transparent muslin folded over
the nose and mouth, so tenderly does it veil the forehead, that the
delicate cloud seems but to heighten and increase each charm. Far, very
far is it from hiding the features from the profaning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>gaze of
man, as was so savagely ordained by Mohammed.</p>
<p class="par">Nose, mouth, and forehead being thus softly shadowed,
the great luminous eyes shine out with doubled brilliancy and
effect.</p>
<p class="par">It is some consolation to Frank ladies to know that,
excepting that never-to-be-sufficiently praised veil, Turkish out-door
costume is absolutely hideous.</p>
<p class="par">A large loose cloak called a &ldquo;feredje&rdquo; is
thrown over the in-door dress, and this is so long that it has to be
gathered up in front when the wearer walks, thus giving her the
appearance of a moving bag or bundle. The huge, unshapely yellow boots
also give a very ungainly appearance. Some of the fashionable ladies,
however, are discarding these ugly over-alls, and are adopting French
boots without heels.</p>
<p class="par">Near the wall were drawn up &ldquo;arabas&rdquo; waiting
for the ladies, and very magnificent &ldquo;turn-outs&rdquo; they
were.</p>
<p class="par">An araba is a native carriage that is much used by
women, as it easily contains eight or ten persons. In shape it is
something between a char-&agrave;-banc and a waggon, but is without
springs. It is generally very gaily decorated and painted, and is
comfortably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>cushioned inside. The top is covered with a thick
red, green, or blue cloth that is fringed with gold. The white oxen
that draw the carriages are generally beautiful creatures, and are also
brilliantly adorned with red trappings and tassels, and have sometimes
their foreheads painted bright pink or blue.</p>
<p class="par">After a time our exhausted bodies became somewhat
refreshed, and our crushed minds began to revive, and to face more
courageously the duties of the day; so at last, summoning a strong
resolution, we rushed across the hot court and over another burning
&ldquo;place,&rdquo; where the gravel felt as if it had been baked in
an oven, and found ourselves in the Imperial armoury.</p>
<p class="par">It was formerly an old chapel, and the remains of a
great white marble cross at one end seemed to rebuke the desecration it
is suffering.</p>
<p class="par">There are some magnificent scimitars, made of the finest
Damascus steel, and some of the hilts and scabbards are of gold,
thickly encrusted with precious stones, but beyond these valuable
decorations the collection of arms did not appear to be of much value.
There are some hundreds of old matchlocks of an obsolete form, and
probably of doubtful utility. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Amongst the curiosities are shown the Bells of Santa
Sophia when it was a Christian church, the ancient keys of
Constantinople, and the gorgeous scimitar of Sultan Mahmoud.</p>
<p class="par">The Palace is but an assemblage of small buildings
joined together by passages, and added to, from time to time, by
successive sovereigns.</p>
<p class="par">We passed through many large rooms or saloons, very
handsome as to size, and richly ornamented with painting and gilding;
but we thought them too low for their length, a defect that is
increased by the heavy decorations of the ceilings.</p>
<p class="par">There was but little furniture&mdash;only a few hard
chairs besides the usual divan, and sometimes a console table with a
French clock upon it.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the smaller rooms were painted in arabesques,
and had porti&egrave;res of blue or red satin over the doors.</p>
<p class="par">From the position of the Palace, however, the views from
the great recesses, full of windows, were quite enchanting.</p>
<p class="par">A long low passage, hung with indifferent French and
English prints, representing naval battles, storms at sea, &amp;c., led
to the bath-rooms&mdash;a pretty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>little set of apartments, with
domed ceilings, beautifully fretted and painted.</p>
<p class="par">The Sultan, however, has long ceased to reside here, and
only comes on certain stated occasions, such as after the feast of the
Bairam.</p>
<p class="par">The grand procession from the mosque on that day is a
magnificent pageant.</p>
<p class="par">A crowd of court pages, resplendent with gold embroidery
and brilliant dresses, precede the monarch, who, mounted on a matchless
snow-white Arabian steed, rides slowly on, surrounded by all the great
dignitaries of the Empire. The Pashas, habited in their state uniforms,
are a mass of gold and precious stones, their saddles and the trappings
of their horses being equally gorgeous.</p>
<p class="par">Amidst all the magnificence of this group the Sultan
alone is dressed with simplicity. He wears a dark frock coat with but
little embroidery about it; but on the front of his fez and on the hilt
of his sword blaze the enormous diamonds that are the pride of the
Imperial treasury, while the housings of his Arab are almost hidden by
the pearls and precious stones by which they are adorned.</p>
<p class="par">On arriving at the Seraglio the Sultan proceeds
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>to the throne-room, and there receives all his
great officers of state. Ambassadors and foreign ministers are received
at other times.</p>
<p class="par">The Sultan goes in state to the mosque every Friday, and
when he is then passing through the streets his people may approach him
to present petitions.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;temennah,&rdquo; as the ordinary mode of
salutation is termed, is a very graceful gesticulation. The hand is
bent towards the ground, as if to take up the hem of the
superior&rsquo;s garment, and then pressed on the heart, forehead, and
lips, to signify both humility and affection.</p>
<p class="par">To call the pleasure-grounds that surround the Seraglio
gardens, is a misnomer according to the European idea of what a garden
should be, for there is scarcely a flower to be seen. They are a series
of beautiful wildernesses, where the nightingales sing from the tangled
thickets, and where each turn in the pathway, each opening amongst the
trees, discloses some enchanting view, either of the bright blue
Bosphorus, or of the misty grey of the distant mountains, or gives a
peep of the city itself, whose innumerable domes and minarets rise
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>dazzlingly white above the dark masses of cypress,
their gilded crescents flashing brightly in the brilliant sunshine.</p>
<p class="par">The soft rustling of the breeze amongst the trees, the
sweet scent of the cypresses and flowering shrubs, all invited to a
halt, and we seated ourselves on a piece of old wall, and idly watched
the ca&iuml;ques as they glided across the Bosphorus.</p>
<p class="par">Near us was a low gateway projecting over the sea, and
in olden times its portals never opened, save when the sack was borne
forth, that contained sometimes the living body of those odalisks whose
conduct had not been <i>sans reproche</i>. In later years it is
believed that these unhappy women were taken to a fortress called
Roumel-Hissei, or Castles in Europe, and there strangled. Their bodies,
sewn up in a sack, were then thrown into the middle of the stream,
where the strength of the current would rapidly carry them out to sea.
At any rate, whatever their punishment, the extent of it is never known
beyond the walls of the Imperial Harem.</p>
<p class="par">The flocks of little birds that are seen skimming
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>so rapidly and so restlessly over the waves of the
Bosphorus, are supposed by the Turks to be the souls of these
unfortunates, who, for their great sin, are for ever condemned to seek
in vain the lover who had led them astray. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">SECTS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Although in olden times the Moslems were both
cruel and fanatical in forcing their religion upon conquered nations,
the Turks of to-day are exceedingly tolerant, and unlike the
Mohammedans of Syria and Asia Minor, who abhor every denomination of
Christians, permit Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Greek chapels to be
erected without opposition in the neighbourhood of Constantinople.</p>
<p class="par">Indeed, at this present time, the Sheyees, as the
followers of Ali are called, are hated by the orthodox party, or
S&uuml;nnees, far more intensely than any sects of Christians are.</p>
<p class="par">However, notwithstanding the religious warfare that
rages between the heads of these two great parties, almost every
description of worship is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>tolerated by the Government, and
there are as many Dissenters therefore in Constantinople as could be
found in London. One of the most popular sects, especially amongst the
lower classes, is that of the Dancing Dervishes, and it is a curious
though a somewhat humiliating spectacle, to see by what extraordinary
means men seek to do homage to their Creator.</p>
<p class="par">The Dervishes assemble every Tuesday and Friday, the
ceremonial being the same on both days. On arriving at the
Tekk&eacute;, or place of worship, we were taken to a large room on the
upper storey. A gallery ran round three sides of this apartment,
portions of it being partitioned off for the use of the Sultan and of
Turkish ladies.</p>
<p class="par">A large circular space is railed off in the centre of
the room and reserved for the Dervishes. A few women and children, some
Turkish officers and soldiers, were also seated in the gallery near us.
No other foreigners were present besides ourselves.</p>
<p class="par">About twenty Dervishes speedily arrived, and their
Mollah or Sheik, a venerable old man, with a long white beard, seated
himself before the niche <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>that indicated the direction of
Mecca. The Dervishes stood before him in a semicircle, without shoes,
their arms crossed upon their breasts, and their eyes humbly cast upon
the ground. They were all without exception pallid and haggard, and
apparently belonged to quite the lower classes. One was a mere boy of
about thirteen or fourteen, another was blind, a third was a negro.</p>
<p class="par">After a few sentences, recited from the Koran, the
Dervishes, headed by their mollah, began to march slowly round and
round the enclosure, adapting their steps to the music (if it could be
so called) of a tom-tom and a sort of flute, that from time to time
uttered a low melancholy wail.</p>
<p class="par">After having made four or five rounds, the mollah
returned to his seat, and the Dervishes, throwing off their cloaks,
appeared in white jackets and long yellow petticoats.</p>
<p class="par">The mollah began to pray aloud, and, as if inspired by
the prayer to which they listened with upturned faces, the Dervishes
began to turn round; slowly at first, but then as the heavenly visions
became more and more vivid, they extended their arms above their heads,
they closed their eyes, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>their countenances showed that they
were in a trance of ecstatic joy.</p>
<p class="par">The mollah ceased to pray, but round and round went the
whirling figures, faster and faster. It was a wonderful sight, so many
men moving with such rapidity, all apparently unconscious, yet never
did one touch the other.</p>
<p class="par">The only sound heard was the occasional flutter of a
petticoat, and the unearthly noise of the music from the gallery, for
as the movements became more rapid, so did the tom-tom increase in
vehemence, and the wailings of the flute became more and more dismally
dreadful.</p>
<p class="par">The effect was singular upon us spectators in the
gallery. After a time many of our neighbours seemed to become, as it
were, infected with the extraordinary scene below, their eyes became
fixed, and they began rocking themselves to and fro in rhythm with the
movements of the Dervishes.</p>
<p class="par">We were also becoming quite giddy from assisting at such
a fatiguing religion, when, happily for us, the mollah bowed his head;
in an instant each man stopped short, and bowed as quietly as if
nothing had happened. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A few prayers and some sentences from the Koran were
again recited, and the Dervishes, who were in a state of heat and
exhaustion quite distressing to see, resumed their cloaks. They then
knelt while more prayers were said. Each man then kissed the hand of
the sheik and those of his brother Dervishes. A blessing was
pronounced, to which the Dervishes responded by a cry, or rather howl,
of Allah-il-Allah, and the ceremony was over. Having seen it, we no
longer wondered at the pallid worn-out appearance of the worshippers,
for the exhaustion both of mind and body must be very great. The object
of the whirling is to distract the mind from earthly things, so as to
enable the worshipper to concentrate himself upon the inexpressible
joys of Paradise.</p>
<p class="par">The exhibition, however, on the whole was painful. It is
always sad to see Our Heavenly Father worshipped in a degrading manner
by His children.</p>
<p class="par">The Dancing Dervishes are said to be popular. They
mostly lead blameless, inoffensive lives, and are very charitable.</p>
<p class="par">Although the ceremonies of the Howling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>Dervishes have been much modified, and though many
of the revolting cruelties they inflicted upon themselves have been
suppressed by law, still the hideous howls and frantic actions to which
they yield, as the inspiration possesses them, make their mode of
worship a scene at which no woman can properly assist.</p>
<p class="par">Passing one day in a ca&iuml;que by a Tekk&eacute; where
the service of Howling Dervishes was going on, we were arrested by the
most tremendous and savage yell that imagination can picture. So
hideous and prolonged was the howl, that it seemed as if it must have
come from a menagerie of wild beasts rather than from the throats of
human beings.</p>
<p class="par">These miserable fanatics begin their worship by placing
their arms on each other&rsquo;s shoulders, they then draw back a step,
and advancing suddenly, each man with a tremendous and savage yell
howls forth, &ldquo;Allah-Allah-Allah-hoo!&rdquo; which must be
repeated a thousand times uninterruptedly. Their countenances become
livid, the foam flies from their lips, many of them fall on the floor
in strong convulsions, from which they only rise to inflict
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>cruel and horrid tortures upon their own wretched
bodies.</p>
<p class="par">The stream that runs through the Bosphorus from the
Black Sea to the Sea of Marmora is so strong that it is almost
impossible for a vessel to stem the current unless aided by steam. We
thankfully, therefore, accepted the kind offer of the captain of the
English man-of-war to take us in tow up to Beyuk&rsquo;dere, a village
near the entrance of the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="par">The yacht was made fast apparently to the frigate, and
off we set, but such was the force of the stream that, at an awkward
corner near Bebek, the immense hawser, that looked as if nothing could
break it, snapped in two like a bit of thread, and the yacht spun round
with the velocity of an opera-dancer. Happily the danger had been
foreseen and guarded against, but we were swept so close in against the
shore that the jib-boom knocked down a piece of garden railing, and
nearly spitted a most respectable old Turk, who was sitting calmly
smoking on his terrace. Some time and much patience were required
before the yacht could be again attached to the frigate, but at last
two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>hawsers made her fast, and we proceeded on our way
up the Bosphorus.</p>
<p class="par">This beautiful stream is very unique in its
characteristics, for while the waters have the depth, brilliancy, and
life of the sea, its shores are cultivated and wooded like the banks of
a river. The gentle sloping hills are covered with dwelling-houses and
kiosks, while the terraces and gardens of stately palaces line the
shore. The Turks have much taste, and are also great lovers of flowers.
The gardens, therefore, are well laid out, and generally well kept. The
climate also is favourable, though the winters are cold, snow sometimes
lying on the ground for many days. The beautiful American
trumpet-creeper grows in perfection, and may be seen hanging over
almost every garden wall, its large bunches of orange-coloured flowers
being in lovely contrast with the brilliant green foliage. Orange trees
and myrtles do well, although they do not attain the same size and
luxuriance as in Sicily and Greece.</p>
<p class="par">Turkish houses are exceedingly picturesque in
appearance. They are seldom more than two storeys high, have many
irregular projections, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>the overhanging roofs extend
considerably beyond the walls. They are usually built of wood, and are
painted white, stone colour, or pale yellow.</p>
<p class="par">Both inside and out they look exquisitely clean; indeed,
inside not a speck of dust is to be seen, the floors are covered with
beautiful matting, and the walls are usually painted a delicate cream
colour. But, alas! a Turkish house is but a whited sepulchre, for
beneath this pure surface vermin prevail to such an extent that at
night they come out by hundreds. It is a horrible plague, but by
constantly painting and the free use of turpentine, most foreigners
succeed in time in ridding their houses of these torments.</p>
<p class="par">We once made a painful experience of the deceptiveness
of appearances. During the summer, our evil angel induced us, and the
Countess S&mdash;, the wife of one of the diplomats, to accept an
invitation from a very rich Armenian merchant to assist at the marriage
of his daughter. The f&ecirc;tes were as usual to extend over three
days, and we were to be his guests for that period.</p>
<p class="par">The house was magnificent in size, and gorgeously
decorated with gold, and velvet, and satin. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>dinner,
or supper, also was as grand as French and Turkish culinary art could
make it. Our entertainers were kind and agreeable people, so we looked
forward to a very pleasant visit.</p>
<p class="par">We three Frank ladies had assigned to us as a sleeping
apartment an immense saloon, superbly gilt and painted, but having
little furniture besides a crimson satin divan, trimmed with gold
fringe, that ran round three sides of the room. Adjoining was a small
bath-room, and our maids had a room at some distance in another wing of
the house.</p>
<p class="par">On retiring to our apartment at night, we found three
comfortable-looking beds had been prepared for us in the usual Eastern
fashion&mdash;that is, laid on the floor.</p>
<p class="par">Each bed had two thick soft mattresses, covered with
pale green satin; the pillows were of the same rich material, and
covered with cambric; the sheets were also of cambric, beautifully fine
and white, and trimmed with broad lace. The coverlets were of green
satin, embroidered, and fringed with gold.</p>
<p class="par">Altogether our couches looked very inviting, especially
after a long afternoon of civilities, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>talk, besides the great
dinner, and the long wedding ceremony, which did not take place till
midnight.</p>
<p class="par">The lights were put out, and we had just sunk into the
pleasant half-conscious dreaminess of a first sleep, when we were
thoroughly awakened by a sudden pattering and rush of little feet
behind the walls, around, above, and below us, while sundry sharp
squeaks announced the neighbourhood of rats.</p>
<p class="par">However, travellers do not allow their night&rsquo;s
rest to be disturbed for trifles; so, covering up our heads, in order
to shut out the disagreeable noise, we resolved not to hear, and tried
to go to sleep.</p>
<p class="par">But it would not do; an unendurably loud squeal close to
Madame S.&rsquo;s head made her jump up hastily, thinking the rats must
be in the room.</p>
<p class="par">We lighted the candles, and then&mdash;our feelings can
better be imagined than described, when we beheld an invading army of
horrors worse than rats, descending the walls, marching over the floor,
and creeping out of every little crack and hollow in the woodwork.</p>
<p class="par">In blank dismay we looked at each other. What
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>was to be done? The divans and ottomans had
already been taken possession of by the enemy. There was not a cane
chair or a table in the room, or we would have mounted upon them.</p>
<p class="par">Help was impossible; there were no bells, we did not
feel justified in disturbing the household, and we were ignorant of the
whereabouts of our maids&rsquo; room.</p>
<p class="par">We were in despair, when a sudden bright inspiration
flashed into the mind of one of us. The bath, the clean white marble,
seemed to offer a safe refuge. In an instant we were there, and
wrapping ourselves up as well as we could, there we remained till
morning. Luckily for us it was a warm summer&rsquo;s night, or we
should have caught our deaths of cold, for we were so eager to escape
from our hateful enemies that we should have accepted any risk.</p>
<p class="par">There we sat in forlorn discomfort&mdash;melancholy
warning of the usual end of a party of pleasure. Luckily a sense of the
ludicrousness of our position made us merry, for as each caught sight
of the other&rsquo;s dismayed white face, we could not help bursting
into fits of laughter, especially when we <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>thought what our friends
would have said could they have seen us.</p>
<p class="par">When day came the foe retired; but as speedily as
ordinary civility would permit, we took our leave, obliged to pretend
important business in Constantinople, and resisting all the kind
pressing of our host and his family, for nothing would have induced us
to pass another night in such a chamber of horrors.</p>
<p class="par">Our poor maids had slept, but showed lamentable traces
of the presence of the foe, who evince decided partiality for fresh and
newly-arrived foreigners.</p>
<p class="par">An Armenian wedding has many forms that are akin to
those of both the Turkish and Christian services. The ceremony is
performed at midnight. The bride is so muffled up in shawls, and veils,
and flowing garments, that face and figure are alike invisible. The
fair damsel is not seen, but the mass of superb silk, lace, and
flashing jewels placed in the middle of the room, indicate her
presence. The bridegroom is asked, as he stands opposite to her,
&ldquo;Will you take this girl to be your wife, even if she be lame,
deaf, deformed, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"
name="pb53">53</a>]</span>blind?&rdquo; to which, with admirable
courage and resignation, he replies, &ldquo;I will take her.&rdquo; The
officiating priest then joins their hands, a silk cord is tied round
the head of each, and, after many prayers and much singing, they are
pronounced man and wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE HAREM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The first visit to a Harem is a very exhausting
business, for everyone feels shy, and everyone is stupid, and the
stupidity and shyness last many hours.</p>
<p class="par">We were fortunate, however, in paying our first
ceremonious visit to the Harem of R&mdash;&mdash; Pasha, whose wife
enjoys, and deservedly, the reputation of being as kind in manner as
she is in heart. Madame P. was so good as to go with us as interpreter.
We were afterwards accompanied by a nice old Armenian woman, well known
amongst the Turkish ladies, as she attends many of them in their
confinements, and is always summoned to assist at weddings and other
festivals, besides being often trusted as the confidential agent for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>making the first overtures in arranging
marriages.</p>
<p class="par">Turkish babies have a hard time of it during the first
month of their existence. Soon after their birth they are rubbed down
with salt, and tightly swaddled in the Italian fashion. The pressure of
these bandages is often so great that the circulation becomes impeded,
and incisions and scarifications are then made on the hands, feet, and
spine, to let out what Turkish doctors and nurses call &ldquo;the bad
blood.&rdquo; The unhappy little creature is only occasionally released
from its bonds, and never thoroughly washed until the sacred month of
thirty days has expired, when it is taken with its mother to the bath.
No wonder that the sickly and ailing sink under such treatment, and
that the mortality amongst infants should be frightful.</p>
<p class="par">Scarcely had our ca&iuml;que touched the terrace that
extends before R&mdash;&mdash; Pasha&rsquo;s handsome palace, when a
small door, that was hardly noticed in the long line of blank wall,
opened as if by magic. We passed through, and found ourselves in a
small shady court surrounded by arcades, up the columns of which
climbing plants were trained. In the centre <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>was a
fountain, with orange trees and masses of flowers arranged around its
basin. A broad flight of steps at the end of the court led to the
principal apartments.</p>
<p class="par">We were received at the foot of the stairs by two black
slaves and several young girls dressed in white, who escorted us to a
large saloon on the upper floor. The ceiling of this room was quite
magnificent, so richly was it painted and gilt. There was the usual
divan, and the floor was covered with delicate matting, but there was
no other furniture of any sort.</p>
<p class="par">The walls were exceedingly pretty, being painted cream
colour, and bordered with Turkish sentences, laid on in mat or dead
gold, a mode of decoration both novel and graceful. We learnt
afterwards that many of the phrases were extracts from the Koran;
others set forth the name and titles of the hanoum&rsquo;s father, who
had been a minister of much influence and importance.</p>
<p class="par">The windows were closely latticed, but notwithstanding
the jealous bars, the views over the Bosphorus and the opposite shore
of Asia were enchanting. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Here we were met by H&mdash;&mdash; Bey, the
Pasha&rsquo;s eldest son, a good-looking boy, about eleven or twelve
years of age, also dressed in white, but wearing some magnificent
jewels in his fez, and by him conducted to another and smaller
apartment, somewhat more furnished than the first, as it had a console
table, with the usual clock, a piano, and some stiff hard chairs ranged
against the walls.</p>
<p class="par">As we entered the room, the folding-doors opposite were
thrown open, and the hanoum (lady of the house), accompanied by her
daughter, and attended by a train of women, advanced to meet us.</p>
<p class="par">We had heard that this lady had once been a famous
beauty. She was still of an age &ldquo;<span lang="fr">&agrave;
pr&eacute;tention</span>,&rdquo; that is to say, about thirty-three or
five, so we had pictured to ourselves something handsome, graceful, and
dignified. We were stricken, therefore, almost dumb with surprise when
we saw a woman, apparently nearer sixty than thirty, very short, and
enormously fat, roll rather than walk into the room. Her awkward
movements were probably as much caused by the extraordinary shape of
her gown, as by her unusual size. Her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>dress, which is called an
&ldquo;enterree,&rdquo; and was but a slight and slender garment, was
made of thin pink silk. It was open to the waist, very scanty in the
skirt, and ended in three long tails, each about a yard wide, and
which, passing on each side and between her feet, must have made
walking quite a matter of difficulty.</p>
<p class="par">This singular robe was fastened round the waist by a
white scarf, and certainly did not embellish, nor even conceal the too
great exuberance of figure.</p>
<p class="par">To show that she received us as equals and friends, the
hanoum wore no stockings, only slippers. When the mistress of the house
enters in stockings it is a sign that she considers her visitors to be
of inferior rank.</p>
<p class="par">We thought the hanoum&rsquo;s head-dress as unbecoming
as her gown. Her hair was combed down straight on each side of her
face, and then cut off short; and she had a coloured gauze handkerchief
tied round her head. The eyebrows were painted with antimony, about the
width of a finger, from the nose to the roots of the hair, and the eyes
were blackened all round the lids. Had the face, however, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>not been
such an enormous size, it would have been handsome, for the eyes were
large, black, and well shaped, and the complexion was fair and good;
but the nose was too large, and the mouth was spoiled from there being
no front teeth. However, she seemed a most good-tempered, kind, merry
creature, and she nodded her head and smiled upon us, while uttering a
thousand welcoming compliments, as if she were really glad to see her
stranger guests.</p>
<p class="par">The daughter was a nice-looking girl, about fourteen or
fifteen, with a face that was more bright and intelligent than actually
pretty. Her figure was slight and graceful, but nevertheless showed
indications that in a few years she, like her mother, might become
prematurely fat and faded.</p>
<p class="par">The eyes were marvellously beautiful&mdash;so large and
lustrous, that they seemed like lamps when the long black lashes were
raised; but her mouth was quite spoiled by bad teeth, a singular defect
in one so young. But Turkish women almost always lose their teeth
early. They seldom use tooth-brushes, and are inordinately fond of
sweetmeats, which they eat from morning till night. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The young lady also wore the &ldquo;enterree,&rdquo; or
tailed dress, which seemed to be a mark of distinction, for all the
attendants wore short coats and full white trousers.</p>
<p class="par">Mother and daughter were both dressed with studied
simplicity, as Turkish ladies receive at home &ldquo;<span lang="fr">en
neglig&eacute;</span>.&rdquo; It is only when they pay visits that they
array themselves sumptuously.</p>
<p class="par">On the present occasion the slaves and women were
gorgeously apparelled, and most magnificent was their
attire&mdash;velvet, satin, cloth of gold, and precious stones quite
dazzled the eye. It was in very earnest a scene from the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When we had been duly placed on the divan, a young slave
brought in a tray, on which were a bowl containing a compote of white
grapes, another full of gold spoons, several glasses of iced water,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="par">Etiquette requires that a spoonful of the sweetmeat
should be eaten, and the spoon then placed in the left-hand bowl. Some
iced water is drunk, and then the tips of the fingers only should be
delicately wiped with an embroidered napkin presented for the purpose.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A calm and graceful performance of this ceremony marks
the &ldquo;grande dame&rdquo; amongst Turkish ladies, and many a
foreigner has come to grief from being unacquainted with these little
details.</p>
<p class="par">In the story of Ivanhoe, Cedric the Saxon is described
as having been despised by the Norman courtiers, because he wiped his
hands with the napkin, instead of drying them in courtly fashion by
waving them in the air; so likewise does a lady lose caste for ever in
a Turkish Harem should she rub her <i>hands</i> with the napkin instead
of daintily passing it over the tips of her fingers.</p>
<p class="par">Now came more slaves bringing coffee. One carried a
silver brazier, on which were smoking several small coffee-pots;
another had the cups&mdash;lovely little things, made of exquisitely
transparent china, and mounted on gold filigree stands; a third carried
a round black velvet cloth, embroidered all over in silver. This is
used to cover the cups as they are carried away empty.</p>
<p class="par">Narghil&eacute;s were now brought, and for some minutes
we all solemnly puffed away in silence. For myself, personally, this
was an anxious moment, for I very much doubted whether my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>powers
as a smoker would enable me to undertake a narghil&eacute;, very few
whiffs being often enough to make a neophyte faint. I looked at my
sister; she was calmly smoking with the serenity and gravity of a Turk.
The hanoum&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on vacancy. She had evidently
arrived at her fifth heaven at least. The pretty daughter was looking
at me, but I did not dare look at her; so, as there was no escape, I
boldly drew in a whiff. Things around looked rather indistinct;
however, I mustered up my courage and drew in another. It was not as
disagreeable as the first, but the indistinct things seemed to get even
fainter, and were, besides, becoming a little black, so I took the
hint, and, finding nature had not intended me for a smoker, quietly let
my pipe go out. Narghil&eacute;s are now seldom used in harems except
for occasions of ceremony. On all subsequent visits cigarettes were
brought, which were much more easily managed.</p>
<p class="par">When the pipes were finished we began to talk, and
mutually inquired the names and ages of our respective children. The
hanoum has three&mdash;the eldest son, H&mdash;&mdash; Bey, the
daughter named Nad&egrave;je, and a little fellow about five years old,
who came running <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>in very grandly dressed, and with a great aigrette
of diamonds in his little fez&mdash;evidently mamma&rsquo;s pet.</p>
<p class="par">H&mdash;&mdash; Bey wanted very much to talk. But, alas!
our Turkish words were sadly few, and conversation through an
interpreter soon languishes and becomes irksome. We asked him his age,
but he did not know. No Turk ever troubles himself or herself about so
trivial a matter. They are satisfied to exist, and think it quite
immaterial how many years they may have been in the world.</p>
<p class="par">Amongst the attendants were two very old women, so dried
up and so withered that they scarcely looked like women. One of them,
who was blind, had been nurse to the hanoum. It was quite charming to
see the kindness and tenderness with which these poor old creatures
were treated. The blind nurse was carefully placed in a comfortable
corner near the windows. H&mdash;&mdash; Bey constantly went to her,
and from time to time, affectionately putting his arm round her neck,
seemed to be describing the visitors to her. These old women were the
only persons who were allowed to sit in the hanoum&rsquo;s presence;
all the others remained standing in a respectful attitude, their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>arms crossed, and generally so motionless that
they might have been statues but for the restless movement of their
eyes.</p>
<p class="par">Remembering the piano, we asked Nad&egrave;je if she
liked music, and after some persuasion she played some wild Turkish
airs with considerable facility and expression.</p>
<p class="par">We were then invited to see the house, which was large
and very handsome. Strangers are always at first, however, somewhat
bewildered by finding there are no bedrooms; but, in fact, every room
is a bedroom, according to necessity or the season.</p>
<p class="par">Hospitality is almost a religious duty amongst the
Turks, and every room is surrounded by cupboards, in which are stowed
away vast numbers of mattresses and pillows ready for any chance guest
who may arrive.</p>
<p class="par">The mattresses are thick and comfortable, and are
generally covered with some pale-coloured satin or silk. The beds are
made upon the floor, and, besides the mattresses and pillows, have
cambric or fine linen sheets and a silk coverlet.</p>
<p class="par">Excepting the bathing apartments attached to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>house, no appliances for washing were to be seen
anywhere; and these ladies seemed surprised that we considered daily
ablution necessary. They assured us that the bath twice a week was
quite as much as was good for the health. Daily washing they consider a
work of supererogation, so they satisfy themselves with pouring a
little rose-water from time to time over their hands and faces.</p>
<p class="par">Upon our expressing a wish to know how the
&ldquo;yashmak,&rdquo; or veil, was arranged, Nad&egrave;je immediately
had one put on, to show how it ought to be folded and pinned; and as by
this time we had become great friends, it was good-naturedly proposed
that we should try the effects of yashmak and &ldquo;feredje,&rdquo;
and the most beautiful dresses were brought, in which we were to be
arrayed.</p>
<p class="par">Further acquaintance with the yashmak increases our
admiration for it. The filmy delicacy of the muslin makes it like a
vapour, and the exquisite softness of its texture causes it to fall
into the most graceful folds.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the feredjes, or cloaks, were magnificent
garments. One was made of the richest purple satin, with a broad border
of embroidered flowers; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>another of brocade, so thick that it
stood alone; another of blue satin worked with seed pearls.</p>
<p class="par">The jackets, &ldquo;enterrees,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.,
were brought in piled upon trays and in numbers that seemed countless.
A Parisian&rsquo;s wardrobe would be as nothing compared with the
multitude and magnificence of the toilettes spread before us.</p>
<p class="par">The jewels were then exhibited. Turkish jewellers
generally mount their stones too heavily, and the cutting is far
inferior to that of Amsterdam; but the hanoum had some very fine
diamonds, really well set. One aigrette for the hair was exceedingly
beautiful. The diamonds were mounted as a bunch of guelder-roses, each
rose trembling on its stem. We also much admired a circlet of lilies
and butterflies, the antenn&aelig; of the butterflies ending in a
brilliant of the finest water. There was also a charming ornament for
the waist, an immense clasp, made of branches of roses in diamonds,
surrounded with wreaths of leaves in pearls and emeralds, a large
pear-shaped pearl hanging from each point.</p>
<p class="par">Having inspected the house we paid a visit to the
garden, now as full of roses as an eastern garden should be. Terraces
made shady by trellises of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href=
"#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>vines and fig-trees hung over the
Bosphorus, and to every pretty view the falling waters of streams and
fountains added their pleasant music to aid the soothing influence of
the scene. At the end of one terrace was a large conservatory full of
beautiful climbing plants; but we were afraid of admiring too much, for
H&mdash;&mdash; Bey had accompanied us, and, after the manner of
eastern tales, whenever we praised anything insisted upon giving it to
us.</p>
<p class="par">We were now preparing to take leave, but our
friend&rsquo;s hospitality was not yet exhausted; and the hanoum,
taking my sister and myself each by the hand, led us into the smaller
saloon, where a collation had been prepared.</p>
<p class="par">On a low circular table, or stool, a large tray had been
placed, on which were a number of dishes containing melons, grapes,
peaches, vegetable marrows, thin slices of cheese, and a variety of
sweetmeats. Piles of bread cut into slices were also arranged round the
tray. There were forks, but the bread supplied the place of spoons.</p>
<p class="par">When we were all seated, rice, pillau, and little birds
roasted in vine leaves were brought in, <i lang="fr">&agrave; la
Fran&ccedil;aise</i>. The kabobs and maccaroni had too much
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>garlic in them for our taste, but a very light
sort of pastry called &ldquo;paklava&rdquo; was excellent, and the rice
was perfection. The cooking we thought very good, and a great contrast
to an experiment we had made a few days previously, in order to see
what ordinary Turkish cookery was like.</p>
<p class="par">One day during our many expeditions for sight-seeing in
Constantinople, we were seized by the pangs of hunger several hours
before we had arranged to return to Therapia, so espying a very nice
clean-looking cook-shop, where a number of cooks, neatly dressed in
white, were chopping and frying little scraps of meat, we proceeded
there and ordered a dish of kabobs <i lang="fr">&agrave; la Turque</i>.
The kabobs in themselves might have been good, and also the fried bread
that accompanied them, but a sauce of fat and garlic had been poured
over both that made the dish not only uneatable, but unendurable. The
good-natured cook seemed surprised at our bad taste, but yielded to
European prejudices, and at last brought some plain rice and tomatoes,
with which we made an excellent luncheon. The favourite Turkish
sweetmeat, called &ldquo;Rahat-la-Koum,&rdquo; or Lumps of Delight, is
excellent when quite fresh, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>and makes much better <i lang=
"fr">eau sucr&eacute;e</i> than plain sugar, as there is a slight
flavour of orange-peel and roses given to the water.</p>
<p class="par">To return, however, to our little breakfast at
R&mdash;&mdash; Pasha&rsquo;s; between each course of meat every one
took what pleased her from the dishes on the table&mdash;fruits,
sweetmeats, or cheese, though the latter was the favourite, as it is
supposed not only to increase the appetite, but to improve the
taste.</p>
<p class="par">Both before and after eating, gold basins and ewers were
brought round, and as we held our hands over the former perfumed water
was poured upon them. The napkins were so beautifully embroidered in
gold thread and coloured silks that it seemed quite a pity to use them
for drying the hands. The repast over, coffee and cigarettes again
appeared, and then, with many friendly invitations and kindly
expressions, we parted.</p>
<p class="par">The hanoum offers us her bath-room, her ca&iuml;ques,
and her carriages, and proposes also to teach us Turkish.</p>
<p class="par">In this harem, as is now generally the case in the best
Turkish families, there is but one wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Our friend, the hanoum, had been a well-portioned bride.
She brought her husband, besides the house we had seen, another at
Beyuk&rsquo;dere, considerable property in land, and a large sum of
money. Where a daughter is so richly dowered, the father usually
stipulates that no other wife shall be taken.</p>
<p class="par">Wives also, in Constantinople, as elsewhere, are
expensive luxuries, for each lady must have a separate establishment,
besides retinue and carriages.</p>
<p class="par">Marriage in Turkey is not a religious ceremony; it is
merely a civil covenant that can be annulled for very trivial reasons
by either party. Public opinion, however, pronounces such separations
disgraceful, and they are seldom resorted to unless for grave
reasons.</p>
<p class="par">A man can put away his wife by pronouncing before a
third person that his marriage is &ldquo;void,&rdquo; but must in that
case resign all the property that his wife has ever possessed. A woman
can only obtain a divorce by going before a cadi, and declaring that
she yields all her dower and property, and claims her freedom. Should
there be children, the mother, if she so elects, can retain the girls
with her until they are seven years old; after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>that age
they return to their father&rsquo;s house, unless an especial
arrangement has been made to the contrary.</p>
<p class="par">A Turkish bath, when taken in a private house, is but a
repetition of the ceremony that may be gone through in any of the
principal bathing establishments in London and Paris; but public
Turkish baths are quite national institutions, and often afford so many
amusing and interesting scenes of real life that no foreigner should
omit to visit them.</p>
<p class="par">Wednesday is the day usually set apart for the Turkish
women; Greek women have Saturday; the other days are allotted to the
men.</p>
<p class="par">The first time we went to the bath, we were quite
oppressed with the extent of the preparations that our friends seemed
to think absolutely necessary. Ladies are always attended by their own
servants, and besides providing themselves with the necessary linen and
toilet appendages, bring all the materials for the subsequent repast,
with coffee and pipes.</p>
<p class="par">Besides several dressing-gowns, there was quite a
mountain of towels, so large that they might almost be called sheets;
some of them long and narrow for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72"
href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>wrapping round the head and
drying the hair. There were wonderful-looking yellow gloves, of various
degrees of coarseness, for rubbing. As we looked at them we quite
shuddered at the thought of what we should have to endure. Then there
were tall wooden clogs, to enable us to walk across the heated floors;
and bowls of metal for pouring boiling water upon us. Besides these and
many other implements apparently for torture, there were brushes and
combs, various sorts of soap for washing, for rubbing, and for
perfuming; bottles of scented waters, rugs, mattresses,
looking-glasses; and, in addition to the basket containing cups,
plates, and dishes, with all the paraphernalia for luncheon, there was
a large box full of perfumes.</p>
<p class="par">Perfumes in the East are not only countless in number,
but of a strength almost overpowering to Western nerves. Literally, not
only every flower, but every fruit, is pressed into the service of the
perfumer.</p>
<p class="par">First in rank and potency is the far-famed
attar-g&ucirc;l, of which one pure drop suffices to scent for years the
stuff on which it is poured. The fine aromatic perfume of the orange
and cinnamon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>flowers is well known, and the more delicate
fragrance of the violet is preserved with all its fresh charm. Still, a
box of Turkish perfumes is almost overpowering from its excess of
sweetness; and, with the exception of the violets, we preferred the
bottles unopened.</p>
<p class="par">When, in addition to the articles already enumerated, we
add that an extensive wardrobe was taken by each lady, that there were
baskets of fruit, cases of confectionery, a complete coffee equipage,
and all necessary appliances for smoking, it will easily be imagined
that the &ldquo;impedimenta,&rdquo; as the Romans so aptly called
travelling luggage, was by no means small. To our uninitiated eyes it
appeared truly formidable, but our friends seemed to think it all
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">en r&egrave;gle</span>;&rdquo; so we held our
tongues and profited by the kind arrangements so affectionately made
for us.</p>
<p class="par">On arriving at the bath we passed through a narrow
passage and came to a large vaulted room, with a double balcony round
two sides of it. The lower balcony, which was about two or three feet
from the ground, was divided by curtains into compartments. These
compartments were occupied by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>ladies either preparing for or
reposing after the fatigues of the bath. In the latter case the
curtains were drawn back, and the inmate could be seen reclining in
indolent enjoyment upon her satin mattress. Occasionally she would
raise the cup of coffee or sherbet to her lips, or, with closed eyes,
would languidly smoke the scented cigarette as her maid combed her
hair, or tinged the delicate tips of her fingers with the beautifying
henna.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the recesses disclosed less gratifying
spectacles. Here an ancient dame, whom the bath had restored to her
natural state of white hair and wrinkles, was having the renovating
process performed of having her scanty locks dyed red, and the hollows
and furrows that time had made filled up by white paint and rouge.</p>
<p class="par">The passion of Turkish women for cosmetics is almost
unaccountable, for the complexions of most of them are exceedingly
good. Their skins are generally of a creamy white, with a delicate
shade of colour; but nothing will satisfy them but the most startling
contrast of white and pink, and it is pitiable to see quite young girls
so disfigure themselves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It required a little effort of courage, when fully
arrayed in the long white bathing-gown and mounted on the tall pattens,
to issue forth from our recess; but we pushed aside the curtains and
appeared, feeling very much, as we essayed to walk on the slippery
marble floor, as an unhappy cat must do who, with walnut shells on her
feet, is forced to perform a promenade on the ice. Two ancient
bath-women speedily came to our assistance. They had been slowly
boiling so many years that they were shrivelled and parched out of the
semblance even of &ldquo;wo-manity,&rdquo; if such a word may be
permitted. Strange to say they had but few wrinkles, but their skin
seemed tightly drawn over their faces, as over the bones of a skull,
and hung loosely in great folds under their chins and around their
throats. They told us afterwards that they had been attendants to the
bath for upwards of thirty years, and had grown so much accustomed to
the heated and sulphureous atmosphere in which they pass the greater
portion of their days, that a purer and fresher air is quite painful to
them. By their aid, with much trepidation, we stumbled across the hall,
and in a few seconds found ourselves in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>sort of pandemonium next
door. In an instant I felt as a shrimp, if he feels at all, must feel
in hot water&mdash;I was boiled. I looked at my companion; her face was
a gorgeous scarlet. In our best Turkish, and with faint and imploring
accents, we gasped out, &ldquo;Take us away!&rdquo; All in vain. For
those who enter here there is no retreat&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Lasciate ogni speranza voi
ch&rsquo;entrate.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">We had come to be boiled and rubbed, and boiled
and rubbed we must be.</p>
<p class="par">We speedily found ourselves seated close to a small
stream of what, at first, seemed like boiling water, of which large
bowlfuls were rapidly thrown over us. When we had a little recovered
from this shock, and our eyes became more accustomed to the clouds of
sulphureous vapours that were rolling around, we began to look with
interest on the singular scene in which we found ourselves.</p>
<p class="par">There were upwards of a hundred women in the bath, the
bathers seated in groups of two or three by each little stream of hot
water. Each woman was attended by one or two slaves, who were
assiduously rubbing their mistress with perfumed soap, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>or
pouring the steaming bowls of boiling water over her.</p>
<p class="par">Numbers of children, without an atom of clothing upon
them, were running about shouting, laughing, and throwing water upon
each other. Many babies also were having a bath against their will, and
the shrieks of these unfortunates were quite deafening. Most of the
women were talking and laughing, and the great height of the hall
caused a reverberation that made the noise most bewildering. The dense
atmosphere and rolling clouds of steam made it also impossible to
ascertain the size of the bath, which however must have been very
large, from the number of persons it contained. From it opened numerous
small rooms still hotter than the first, although the shock on entering
was not nearly as great as that experienced when arriving at the great
hall. Here the soaping and rubbing processes were performed with such
vigour that we felt as if nothing was left of us, and right glad were
we when we found ourselves once more in the comfortable dressing-room,
with just enough strength left to throw ourselves on the luxurious
mattresses and appreciate, to its full extent, the kindness that had
supplied us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>with coffee, fruit, luncheon, &amp;c. How many
hours passed in pleasant idleness, it is impossible to say. One takes
no note of time after a Turkish bath; and also, when a little refreshed
and revived, we were exceedingly amused and interested by the scenes
and conversations around us.</p>
<p class="par">It seemed that those who wished to have a private
dressing-room, such as that we had, paid a little more than the
ordinary price, the majority of the ladies availing themselves of the
large general dressing-rooms on the balcony above.</p>
<p class="par">Towards the afternoon the bathing was almost over, and
the club, as it were, began. The whole of the immense space below us
was occupied by groups of ladies, who, reclining on their mattresses,
chattered to each other, smoked, drank coffee, and ate fruit, as their
maids dried, combed, and dyed their hair, for there were but few who
did not use a little henna. The children, who were now clothed, ran
about as before, but happily most of the suffering babies had gone to
sleep.</p>
<p class="par">Two middle-aged ladies near us were evidently, and with
much diplomacy, negotiating the preliminaries of a marriage. Contrary
to the usual state <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span>of the case in Europe, the
&ldquo;riches&rdquo; of the lady and the &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; of the
gentleman were amply dilated upon.</p>
<p class="par">A little further on two handsome young women, probably
the inmates of the same harem, had evidently had a violent quarrel,
only subdued by the soothing influence of the bath. Beyond them a fair
Georgian, the prettiest woman in the room, reclined negligently against
a heap of cushions; her slaves were deluging her with perfumes, while a
hideous old crone was earnestly whispering some tale into her ear,
probably one of love, as the girl coloured and looked pleased, as she
occasionally glanced suspiciously around, as if to assure herself that
no one was listening to the communication.</p>
<p class="par">In one corner a group of matronly-looking women were
describing the merits and charms of their respective babies, while
shouts of merry laughter, proceeding from another, showed where a
number of young girls had collected together. The whole scene was
singularly picturesque and interesting, and gave us a very favourable
impression of the native refinement of Turkish women.</p>
<p class="par">Nothing could be more decorous than the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>appearance and manners of every woman there
present, but in one respect we were disappointed. There was a
remarkable want of beauty. With the exception of the pretty Georgian,
there was scarcely a good-looking woman in the room. The handsomest
were, beyond all question, some coal-black Nubian slaves. One of them
had the most beautiful figure we had ever seen. Tall, lithe, and
supple, her small head exquisitely poised on a throat round and shapely
as that of a statue, she moved about with the undulating grace of some
wild animal. Coal-black though she was, her features had none of the
unseemly coarseness and grotesqueness of the negro; on the contrary,
the nose was delicately cut, while her mouth, though full, had the
waving lines of beauty, only seen in the Egyptian sphinx.</p>
<p class="par">Although a Turkish bath is certainly a most inviting
luxury, and has temporarily a flattering effect upon the skin, making
it for some hours, even days afterwards, exquisitely white, smooth, and
soft, still, owing to the great heat, and the quantity of sulphur with
which the air is charged, an undue indulgence in bathing has in the end
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>a deteriorating effect upon female beauty. The
muscles become relaxed, and the skin, although it remains soft and
delicate, loses its elasticity; the hair also rapidly falls off, and
what is left becomes thin and weak. The too devoted votaries of the
bath, therefore, speedily become enervated both in mind and body, and
whilst still young in years fade into a premature old age. The
indolence also which it creates does much to increase the tendency to
undue corpulence, so destructive to the fair proportions of Eastern
women. Most of them, after middle life, either become shrivelled and
dried up, or else have both features and form swelled to very uncomely
dimensions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE HAPPY VALLEY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Amongst the many lovely valleys that surround
Constantinople, the two most perfectly charming are the Valley of the
Sultan and that called by the Franks the Sweet Waters of Asia. Both are
carpeted by the freshest and greenest sward; both are shaded by
magnificent trees; and numerous little streams, descending from the
neighbouring heights, not only charm by the pleasant music of their
waters, but enable pleasure-seekers to boil their coffee <i>al
fresco</i>.</p>
<p class="par">These delicious spots, so green and fresh, nestled, as
it were, amidst comparatively barren hills, seem to invite all the
happy ones of earth to come and repose under the tender shade of their
great trees. The air, though soft, is so fresh and invigorating,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>that the fact of existence seems a joy. Nature
rejoices on all sides&mdash;the brilliant sky above, the bright rays
glancing through the trees, the merry little wavelets that show their
white heads upon the intense blue of the Bosphorus, the birds singing
blithely from every coppice and tangled brake&mdash;all nature smiles
in sunshine, hope, and joy. Little troubles and unworthy anxieties fade
and fall away, and life seems for a few short hours to be the delight
that Our Heavenly Father probably once meant it to be.</p>
<p class="par">There are few things more charming in the Turkish
character than the honest, hearty love for the beauties of nature that
prevails in all classes. From the Sultan to the meanest and poorest of
his subjects, whenever a holiday occurs, all hasten to enjoy the luxury
of fresh air and the soft green sward, there to while away the few
hours (perhaps in both cases) hardly wrung from many days of weary and
exhausting toil. In the winter the men of course frequent the
coffee-shops, there to enjoy their pipes and the long histories of the
professional story-tellers, but in the summer every valley is thronged
with people, all evidently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href=
"#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>enjoying themselves with a
completeness and an absence of Western <i>ennui</i> that is most
refreshing to behold.</p>
<p class="par">Many a delightful hour did we pass in these valleys. The
merry melodious voices of the women, the ringing laughter of the
children, made a music very pleasant to the ear; and the eye was
charmed with the brilliant beauty of the colouring, and the picturesque
grace of the groups that surrounded one on every side.</p>
<p class="par">On a Friday, or other holiday, many hundreds of people
congregate at the Sweet Waters both of Europe and Asia. The women,
arrayed in gorgeous dresses, recline on carpets beneath the trees,
little spirals of smoke ascend from the numerous pipes, the
narghil&eacute; bubbles in its rose-water, the tiny cups of coffee send
forth a delicious fragrance, the perfume of fresh oranges and lemons
fills the air. The still more exquisite sweetness of orange blossoms is
wafted towards us, as a gipsy flower-girl passes through the groups,
carrying many a mysterious bouquet, of which the flowers tell a perhaps
too sweet and too dangerous love-tale to the fair receiver.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Then a bon-bon seller comes, laden with his box of
pretty sweets. Many are really good, especially the sweetmeat called
Rahat-la-Koum, when quite fresh, and another, made only of cream and
sugar flavoured with orange-flower water.</p>
<p class="par">Every now and then the wild notes of some Turkish music
may be heard from the neighbouring hills&mdash;the band of a passing
Turkish regiment; or perhaps the monotonous but musical chant of some
Greek sailors falls on the ear, as they struggle to force their boat up
the tremendous stream of the Bosphorus.</p>
<p class="par">Seen from a little distance, and shaded by the
flattering folds of the &ldquo;yashmak,&rdquo; Oriental women almost
always look pretty; but when, as they often do, the fair dames let the
veil fall a little, and the features become distinctly visible, the
illusion is lost at once.</p>
<p class="par">The eyes are magnificent, almond-shaped, tender and
melting, but, with very few exceptions, the nose and mouth are so large
and ill-formed, that the face ceases to be beautiful; the superb eyes
not compensating for the want of finish in the other features.</p>
<p class="par">As a class, the Armenians were the best-looking,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>but the women&rsquo;s head-dress was remarkably
becoming. They wear a thin coloured handkerchief, with a broad fringe
of gauze flowers, tied coquettishly on one side of the head, long
plaits of hair being arranged round it like a coronet.</p>
<p class="par">As in Western countries, the middle and lower classes
seemed to enjoy themselves the most. They sat on the grass, and talked
to their friends. They could eat their fruit and drink their coffee
<i>al fresco</i>, while some of the Sultan&rsquo;s odalisks, and other
great ladies, shut up in their arabas and carriages, performed a slow
and dreary promenade up and down the middle of the valley.</p>
<p class="par">Very weary did some of these poor things look, but the
guard of black slaves on each side the carriage forbade any hope of an
hour&rsquo;s liberty. Happily, excepting in the Sultan&rsquo;s harem,
it is now becoming the fashion for the ladies to descend from their
carriages and to pass the afternoon beneath the trees.</p>
<p class="par">Many other Eastern fashions are also becoming modified.
The huge yellow boots are disappearing, French ones taking their place;
parasols and fans are also used, and all the fashionable ladies now
wear gloves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Besides the charming valleys already mentioned, the
shores of the Bosphorus abound in pretty villages, where the great
Turkish families, the foreign ministers, and principal European
merchants have palaces, and where they generally pass the summer.</p>
<p class="par">The most important of these villages are Therapia and
Beyuk&rsquo;dere. The English and French ambassadors have each a palace
at the former, and as we had the good fortune to pay a long and most
happy visit to our kind friends at the English Embassy, we came to love
Therapia as a very dear and happy home.</p>
<p class="par">There is no place in the world, perhaps, where the air
has so exhilarating an effect as on the shores of the Bosphorus. The
soft, sweet breeze from the hill side seems to temper the fresh, salt
wind that is borne in from the Black Sea; and how great was the delight
when we sometimes turned to the sea-shore, after a long ride in the
forest of Belgrade!</p>
<p class="par">Can anything be more beautiful on a sunny evening than
to watch the sea steal quietly up the glittering beach?&mdash;to see
wave after wave gracefully bend its snow-capped head, and then, falling
over, leave a line of shining water all along the shore? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>And
riding down upon the cool, wet sand, how grateful to the tired horses
is the tender lapping of the soft, soothing water, as the little waves
curl round their heated feet! Ah! why will happy hours pass so soon
away?&mdash;why does a pang ever mingle with the thought of a joy that
is past?</p>
<p class="par">Beyuk&rsquo;dere is so pretty, so graceful, and so
unreal-looking, especially as we saw it for the first time, on a bright
moonlight night, that it seemed like a dream or a scene in a play. And
yet the houses are very real, and some of them very handsome; for
example, the Russian Embassy, where a clever and charming host,
excellent dinners, and most agreeable evenings were very delightful
realities.</p>
<p class="par">Still, most of the smaller houses look as if they were
cut out of cardboard. They have also an unusual number of windows,
which, when lighted up at night (and the shutters are seldom closed, on
account of the heat), give many of the streets the appearance of the
side-scenes at the opera. So strong is the illusion, that it is
difficult to cease expecting that the beautiful heroine in muslin
apron, with little pockets, will presently look out of the latticed
window, or that the irascible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>father, in brown coat and large
buttons, will issue forth from that most fragile and operatic-looking
door.</p>
<p class="par">When we had been a few weeks at Constantinople, and had
visited some half-dozen harems, we began to think we knew something
about Turkish life, and it was not until we had been there some months,
and become acquainted with the families of most of the principal
pashas, ministers, &amp;c., that we discovered how little we really
knew about it.</p>
<p class="par">But although we might change our opinions respecting
many domestic customs and manners, time and more intimate knowledge of
their character only increased our liking and admiration for the Turks,
both men and women.</p>
<p class="par">Benevolence and kindness are the principal
characteristics of both sexes. During the whole period of our stay in
Turkey we never saw even a child ill-treat a hapless animal.</p>
<p class="par">Travellers, especially women, are seldom sufficiently
conversant with the laws of a country to be able to expatiate with much
accuracy on such matters. Turkish laws are said to be bad; perhaps they
are so, but certainly there are few cities in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>Europe
where the streets can be so safely traversed, both by night and day, as
those of Constantinople.</p>
<p class="par">Turkish manners, also, are peculiarly agreeable. Turks
are not ashamed to show that they wish to please&mdash;that they wish
to be courteous; happily they have not yet adopted that brusquerie of
manner that is becoming so prevalent in the West.</p>
<p class="par">The fault is perhaps an overabundance of ceremony and
etiquette. Even in their own houses, in the seclusion of home, the
master of a family is treated with a respectful deference which would
astonish many Christian sons, who unhappily often now only look upon
their father as the purse-holder, out of whom they must wring as much
money as possible.</p>
<p class="par">In the Selamluk<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1163src"
href="#xd21e1163" name="xd21e1163src">1</a> no person seats himself
without the permission of the master of the house; in the harem the
same etiquette is observed, the hanoum, or first wife, reigning there
supreme.</p>
<p class="par">We had often heard that Eastern women enjoyed in reality
far more liberty than their Western sisters, and in some respects this
is certainly true; but in point of fact the liberty they possess in
being able to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>go in and out unquestioned, to receive and pay
visits where they choose, does not at all compensate for the slavery of
the mind which they have to endure, from being cut off from the
education and mental improvement they would gain by association with
the other sex.</p>
<p class="par">Mental imprisonment is worse even than bodily
imprisonment, and by depriving a woman of legitimate ambition, by
taking from her the wish for mental culture, she is reduced to the
condition of a child&mdash;a very charming one, probably, when young,
but a painful position for her when, youth having departed, the power
of fascination decays with the loss of beauty; and though in some
instances it is well known that the natural talent of the woman has had
the power of retaining her husband&rsquo;s heart, still it too often
happens that, after very few years of love and admiration, he turns to
one still younger and fairer to charm his hours of leisure.</p>
<p class="par">Not only did we constantly see Madame R&mdash;&mdash;
and her charming daughter Nad&egrave;je, and the wives and relatives of
the ministers, &amp;c., whose acquaintance we made, but we had the
honour of being invited to pay visits to most of the members of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>imperial family; and the more we saw of the
Turkish ladies the more we liked the kindly, gentle-hearted women who
received us with such friendly hospitality.</p>
<p class="par">In the royal palaces there was of course more splendour,
more gold, more diamonds, more slaves&mdash;especially the hideous
black spectres, who are often so revoltingly frightful that they look
like nightmares. But in all essentials a description of a visit to one
harem serves to describe the receptions at all.</p>
<p class="par">During our visits to their wives the pashas often
requested permission to enter the harem, and we were delighted to make
the acquaintance of F&mdash;&mdash; Pasha, a statesman distinguished
throughout Europe by his enlightened views, his generous nature, and by
the improvements his wise legislation has effected for his country.
Successive visits, both to his lovely palace on the Bosphorus and to us
on board the yacht, turned this acquaintance into a friendship which we
valued as it indeed deserved.</p>
<p class="par">It was sometimes amusing to see the astonishment of the
women when they found we did not object to converse with the pasha.
They could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>hardly understand that we would allow him to enter
the harem during our stay there.</p>
<p class="par">In deference to their feelings we, however, always drew
down our veils before the master of the house entered, a proceeding
which we were aware materially increased their respect for us, and for
our sentiments of reserve and propriety.</p>
<p class="par">More intimate acquaintance with our Turkish friends
enabled us to see how often they were annoyed and disturbed, probably
quite unintentionally, by the proceedings of their European guests.</p>
<p class="par">Madame F&mdash;&mdash; is a charming person, clever and
intelligent to an unusual degree. She is said to possess great and
legitimate influence with her husband. She invited us one day to a
large party, consisting of most of the &ldquo;lionnes&rdquo; of the
Constantinopolitan world.</p>
<p class="par">Some of these ladies were very pretty, and perhaps
rather fast. Many of them had adopted several French fashions, wearing
zouaves and Paris-cut bodies instead of their own pretty jackets and
chemises, a change we thought much for the worse. The great mixture of
colours, also, which looks so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>well in the Turkish full dress of
ceremony, seemed much out of place in a semi-French costume.</p>
<p class="par">Our Paris bonnets produced quite a furore. So much were
they admired that we lent them to be tried on by the whole assembly.
Each fair Turk thought she looked lovely in the ludicrous little fabric
of lace and flowers, though we would not be so untruthful as to say
they were half as becoming as their own fez, with the grand aigrettes
of diamonds, which they place so coquettishly on the side of their
pretty heads.</p>
<p class="par">These ladies were wonderfully &ldquo;well up&rdquo; in
all the gossip of Constantinople. They were perfectly cognisant of all
the little details of every embassy and legation, knowing every member
of them by sight.</p>
<p class="par">They have a game which is played for sugarplums. Various
diplomats or well-known persons are imitated by some peculiarity they
have, such as a mode of walking, talking, bowing, &amp;c. The
spectators have to guess who is meant, every failure being paid for by
a certain number of bon-bons.</p>
<p class="par">Of course the descriptions are unflattering; the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>more they are so the greater being the laughter
excited. Many of the described would have been astonished could they
have seen how cleverly they were caricatured. There was a luckless
secretary of one of the smaller legations who seemed a favourite
victim, as he certainly had many &ldquo;odd&rdquo; ways.</p>
<p class="par">Amongst the many distinguished men whose acquaintance we
made was C&mdash;&mdash; Pasha, a man who in talent may perhaps rival,
but who in moral qualities is far below, F&mdash;&mdash; Pasha. In
fact, C&mdash;&mdash; Pasha, from the stormy impetuosity of his
character, and from an unfortunate tendency he has of occasionally
taking the law into his own hands, rather resembles the old Turk as he
was, than the modern Turk as he is.</p>
<p class="par">C&mdash;&mdash; Pasha is a handsome man, about fifty
years of age, with a very intellectual, acute face. A singularly square
chin, and a closely-compressed mouth, give an expression of fierce
determination, almost amounting to cruelty, to the countenance when in
repose. As soon as he speaks, however, the whole face lights up with a
kind of merry good-humour, which is inexpressibly winning; and though,
if all tales may be believed, he is somewhat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>of a
Bluebeard, and has committed crimes which, in other countries, would
have brought him to the scaffold, it is impossible not to be pleased,
almost in spite of oneself, by a manner unusually frank and
earnest.</p>
<p class="par">There is a story (let us hope it is only a story, and
not a truth) that he put to death, with his own hand, one of his
odalisks, and a young secretary to whom he had seemed much attached. It
is said that the pasha, walking one day in his garden, saw a rose
thrown from a window in the harem. The flower was picked up by the
secretary, who put it to his lips, and kissed it passionately as he
looked up at the lattice. Burning with indignation and jealousy, the
pasha hastily repaired to the harem, and saw a young slave looking out
of the window from which the rose had been thrown. Drawing his knife,
he crept softly behind the unfortunate girl, and in an instant had
plunged it into her throat. The death-cry of the unhappy victim
startled the household, and the secretary, finding the intrigue had
been discovered, at first fled to the hills, but subsequently took
refuge with one of the foreign <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>ministers. He remained in the
latter&rsquo;s household for a considerable time&mdash;so long, indeed,
that he flattered himself the affair had been forgotten.</p>
<p class="par">At the expiration of some months, C&mdash;&mdash; Pasha
sent or wrote to the young man, requesting him to return, and assuring
him that, as he had thus with his own hand punished the guilty woman,
his anger had been appeased.</p>
<p class="par">The secretary, therefore, resumed his post, and for some
weeks all apparently went well. One day, however, the pasha, attended
by his secretary, was again walking in the garden. On arriving at the
spot where the rose had fallen, the pasha requested the young man to
gather a flower that was growing near. Unsuspicious of danger, the
secretary obeyed, and as he bent down for the purpose, was stabbed to
the heart by his revengeful master.</p>
<p class="par">This deliberate murder&mdash;for such, in fact, it
was&mdash;made a considerable stir for a time; but the high rank and
great influence of the offender prevailed against justice, and the
affair was ultimately hushed up, the pasha, it is believed, having only
to pay a considerable sum of money to the family of the murdered man.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It must not be supposed that there are many, if indeed
any, modern Turks like our agreeable but unprincipled friend; but it is
said that occasionally an erring odalisk disappears, and as it is
nobody&rsquo;s business to inquire about her, no troublesome questions
are asked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">AN EASTERN BANQUET.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Shortly before our departure from Constantinople,
we were so fortunate as to assist at a very grand Turkish breakfast. It
was given by A&mdash;&mdash; Pasha in honour of the brother of the
Viceroy, and to it were invited the principal members of the foreign
embassies and legations, the Turkish ministers, Lord S&mdash;&mdash;,
and our humble selves.</p>
<p class="par">The banquet was to take place in a lovely kiosk
belonging to A&mdash;&mdash; Pasha, at Anokoi, a village on the
Bosphorus, between Therapia and Pera.</p>
<p class="par">As the English ambassador&rsquo;s state ca&iuml;que
passed the different military stations on its way down the Bosphorus,
the drums beat, and the guard turned out to do honour to the great man;
a proceeding far more agreeable to us spectators than to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span><i>attach&eacute;</i>, who, having been
&ldquo;told off&rdquo; for the purpose, was placed in a prominent part
of the boat, that he might perpetually take off his hat in answer to
the incessant salutes.</p>
<p class="par">On arriving at Anokoi, we found the landing-place
beautifully arranged with awnings, carpets, and flags. Gaily-decorated
arabas also were in waiting to convey the guests to the top of the hill
on which the kiosk stands.</p>
<p class="par">The road was steep and dusty, and the day was hot, so
that we were not sorry to arrive at our destination; but had the way
been twice as steep, and even if we had had to ascend it on foot, it
would have been worth the climb to see the magnificent view. The kiosk
was built on the edge of a rocky but wooded bank hanging over the
Bosphorus, and being thus on nearly the highest point near
Constantinople, an exquisite panorama of sea and land was stretched
before us, bounded only on one side by the lovely blue outline of
Olympus, on the other by the expanse of misty grey that marked the
Black Sea.</p>
<p class="par">Our host, A&mdash;&mdash; Pasha, a specimen of the
accomplished modern Turkish gentleman, met us at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>entrance of the garden. Besides being very
good-looking and agreeable, he speaks French admirably well, having
been minister and ambassador at several foreign courts. This was, in
fact, a farewell entertainment, as he was soon leaving Constantinople
for the post to which he had just been nominated.</p>
<p class="par">The banqueting-room was a large and lofty hall,
beautifully painted in the Munich fashion, and handsomely furnished
with satin hangings and curtains, abundantly supplied with Parisian
couches, chairs, and lounges.</p>
<p class="par">The table was adorned with a profusion of gold and
silver plate, interspersed with groups of flowers very artistically
arranged.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="fr">d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> was
excellent, but immensely long, for after the cinnamon, vegetable,
white, and other soups, came an apparently endless procession of meats,
boiled, baked, roasted, and stewed. There were whole animals and minced
ones, also chickens and other poultry, stewed with pistachios and
olives, fish rolled into balls and cooked with raisins, little birds
wrapped in leaves, rice in many ways, pillau, caviare, fish known and
unknown, innumerable vegetables and cheeses, and upwards of twenty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>sorts of sweets. The cookery was very good,
though some of the dishes were overabundantly spiced for a Western
palate.</p>
<p class="par">The pastry was admirable, and the conserves quite the
perfection of culinary art, for not only were the fruit and flowers
excellent to eat, but they were beautiful to look at, the
orange-flowers, rose-buds, and violets retaining their shape and colour
as well as their flavour. The Armenians, who are the principal
confectioners, jealously guard their most celebrated recipes, that
descend in many families as precious heirlooms from father to son.</p>
<p class="par">I was so fortunate as to be seated next a diplomat who
thoroughly understands and appreciates both Turkish and French cookery
in all their minutest branches. He was kind enough to superintend my
dinner, and an admirable selection he made, though at the same time it
must be confessed that he seasoned the &ldquo;plats&rdquo; by such
brilliant conversation that the contents of the plate before me were
often unnoticed.</p>
<p class="par">To eat of such an army of dishes was impossible; some of
the unlearned attempted it, not knowing, luckless creatures, what was
before them, but broke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>down early in the day, and were
&ldquo;nowhere&rdquo; when the fruit came. This was really a loss, for
a murmur of admiration passed round the table, even the most trained
and hardened old gourmands not being able to refrain from praise when
the immense piles of fruit, in the perfection of their delicate beauty,
were brought in&mdash;grapes, pines, peaches, apricots, figs,
pomegranates, Japanese medlars, dates, almonds, nectarines, melons,
citrons, oranges, sweet lemons&mdash;it is impossible to recollect even
the names, but each fruit was so beautiful that an artist would have
said it was a picture. However, its fair loveliness did not preserve it
from being eaten, for Constantinople is a climate which makes fruit a
necessary of life; without it one would really have fever.</p>
<p class="par">There were two bands, one instrumental and one vocal,
that performed alternately during breakfast. The voices in the latter
were not bad, though rather nasal, but the pieces they sang were
pitched too high, and in consequence sounded monotonous and strained.
The instrumental music was infinitely better. There were some
Wallachian gipsy airs which were perfectly charming. Wild and mournful,
like most national music, they were full of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>character, and every now and then a tender
melody broke forth that was inexpressibly touching.</p>
<p class="par">A&mdash;&mdash; Pasha was so kind as to send us the next
day the music of those we most admired, but without the wild, savage
clang of Eastern instruments they lose much of their effect.</p>
<p class="par">When the breakfast was at length over, we all adjourned
to the garden, where sofas and chairs had been placed in the shade,
round a small fountain.</p>
<p class="par">Coffee and pipes were brought, and very merry and
amusing was the talk.</p>
<p class="par">Certainly the Ottomans are moving onwards with the
times. A hundred years ago who would have supposed that a grave Turk
would have been entertaining, not only Christians, but Christian women,
and also devoting himself to them with an attention and kindness worthy
of the most &ldquo;preux chevalier&rdquo; in Christendom?</p>
<p class="par">Rich and luxurious as had been the entertainment, the
arrival of the pipes formed the culminating point of magnificence.</p>
<p class="par">Many of them were so encrusted with jewels that it was
difficult to form any estimate as to their value. The pieces of amber
of which they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span>made were almost priceless, both for their
size and the delicacy of their tint. Yellow amber should be of the
palest primrose hue, but there is another shade that is now much
prized, namely, the black amber. This is exceedingly rare, and of
course, therefore, exceedingly costly.</p>
<p class="par">The pasha was kind enough to give us a piece when he
paid his last farewell visit the day before we left the Bosphorus. Most
of our kind friends came on board the yacht that day to wish us
good-bye and God speed, for at dawn the next day we were to sail for
the Crimea, and to judge by the stories that have been poured into our
ears for some weeks past, the perils of the Black Sea for a sailing
vessel must not only be very numerous, but very extraordinary.</p>
<p class="par">Unluckily the only &ldquo;<i>detaining</i>&rdquo; result
has been that our maid has taken fright, and resolutely refuses to
leave Constantinople. She says that, though devotedly attached to us,
she does not think it right to put herself to death for anybody,
especially as she has an old mother dependent upon her. She proposes,
however, to return to us should we come back alive, which with tears in
her eyes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>she declares is &ldquo;most improbable.&rdquo;
Such being the cheerful view taken of our expedition, we find it
impossible on such short notice to replace her. The few maids to be
found here have an idea that we are doomed to death, and no amount of
wages can tempt them to share our fate. One day we were buoyed up by
the hope that there was a female heart stout enough to share our
perils, but when a colossal German, about five feet ten high, and broad
in proportion, appeared before us, <i>our</i> courage failed, and we
felt she would be an incubus not to be endured. Besides, it would be a
question of the nicest calculation whether, provided even if she could
get down the companion, she could by possibility squeeze into her
cabin. The idea, too, of getting her on deck, should there be any sea,
made the brain lose itself in a maze of distressing conjectures.</p>
<p class="par">As for ourselves, we began to grow proud of our courage
in braving such unknown dangers, and felt rather like Christian in
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; as he prepares to plunge into
the flood, and penetrate the dark mist that veils the other side.</p>
<p class="par">But in truth the opening into the Black Sea is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>often a very &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; looking
place, for at every change of weather a dense white fog hangs over
it.</p>
<p class="par">All the bad winds are said to come from the Black Sea,
all the rain, all the squalls, so that at any rate, deserved or
undeserved, it has got a very bad name, and we know that a bad name,
whether given to a dog, a man, or a sea, loses nothing by time or
telling.</p>
<p class="par">The sea was calm, and the wind was favourable; but our
first day&rsquo;s sail on the Black Sea was marked, and our hearts were
troubled by a domestic calamity.</p>
<p class="par">About ten days before we left the Bosphorus a bottle had
been let down into the water to cool, and when it was drawn up again a
curious little fish was found entangled in the string. It was about
five inches long, and had the head of a horse, with the body and tail
like those of the old fabulous dragon. We found it was called the
Hippocampus, or Sea Horse; and though not uncommon on the coasts of
Japan and China, it is rarely seen in these seas, and still more rarely
taken alive.</p>
<p class="par">The Russian Ambassador, Prince L&mdash;&mdash;, who
happened to be on board when the capture was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>made, is a great naturalist, and by his advice
we put our prize into a glass bowl, with a small supply of its
favourite seaweed. For many days the little creature did very well, and
we used to watch with much interest its active, graceful movements. One
morning, to our great astonishment, we found our friend surrounded by
an immense family, about fifty little ones having made their appearance
during the night. The mother seemed none the worse for such a
prodigious event; and her children, who were about a quarter of an inch
long, and perfect sea-horses in miniature, darted about with as much
activity and liveliness as their parent.</p>
<p class="par">We were so unfortunate as to possess an excellent
steward,&mdash;Domenico by name, Neapolitan by birth,&mdash;who, with
the most earnest endeavours to do right, and with the most anxious
activity in so doing, always contrived to understand everything
<i>&agrave; travers</i>, and who, therefore, by his misplaced zeal and
energy, often drove us to the verge of distraction by his
well-intentioned but unlucky efforts. We had, of course, given him
strict orders never to touch our little pets.</p>
<p class="par">The yacht lay-to just opposite a small village at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>the entrance of the Black Sea, and here Domenico
went on shore to get some of the necessaries always required at the
last moment. Seeing some of the seaweed which we needed for our little
fish, and which it was not always easy to get, he wisely brought back
some with him, but in his unwise zeal was rashly putting it into the
bowl when, being suddenly called, he turned hastily, and stumbled,
upsetting the glass and its precious contents. The mother was put back
alive, but alas! all the fragile little ones were dead. Great was our
grief and vexation, and we had not even the consolation of scolding the
wretched Domenico. He was so distressingly contrite and unhappy at the
fatal results of his disobedience, that he left us nothing to add to
the storm of reproaches that he showered upon himself. The mother
sea-horse lived for about a fortnight after this sad misfortune;
whether she mourned at having thus lost, at one fell swoop, all her
large little family, or whether she herself had sustained some injury,
we could never discover; but she dwindled and dwindled, and was found
one day dead; so all we could do was to preserve her little remains in
spirits of wine. We had given a great <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>many of the young
ones to Prince L&mdash;&mdash;, who wished to take them to St.
Petersburg with him, but they did not survive many days, and their
little dried bodies alone reached their destination.</p>
<p class="par">A favourable breeze soon carried us within sight of the
coast of the Crimea. The air was balmy, the sea was bright, though it
had no longer the intense blueness that is so characteristic of the
Bosphorus and the Mediterranean; the atmosphere, also, had a certain
mistiness about it more akin to northern regions. We were not very far
from the land, and could see that the country was flat and barren. In
the far distance we could trace the faint outlines of a range of hills.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">EUPATORIA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We coasted on, the shore becoming lower and lower,
until at length nothing was to be seen but an arid, sandy plain
stretching away for miles. Not a tree or house broke its dull
uniformity.</p>
<p class="par">In the midst of this gloomy desert is Eupatoria. It
would be difficult to find a more wretched-looking little place. The
town consists of a tumble-down mosque, a couple of Christian churches,
a caravanserai for strangers, and a few low miserable houses. There is
also a small wooden landing-place, and a few huts, like sentry-boxes,
scattered along the shore.</p>
<p class="par">These huts, however, make the fortune, such as it is, of
Eupatoria. They are the famous mud baths well known in the Crimea, and
during the summer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span>are resorted to, from all parts of Southern
Russia, by persons afflicted with skin diseases.</p>
<p class="par">There is one sad malady for which these baths are
peculiarly efficacious. This complaint consists in the skin becoming so
thin that at times the slightest exertion may cause h&aelig;morrhage to
take place from any or all parts of the body; a wasting consumption
being thus produced that usually ends fatally.</p>
<p class="par">The baths at Eupatoria have effected some wonderful
cures, and their reputation is of course increasing.</p>
<p class="par">The patient lies for some hours every day in the soft,
healing muddy water, which, by degrees, makes a sort of artificial
coating by leaving the sediment upon the body. The skin is thus
protected until it can regain its proper health and thickness. We
afterwards met a Russian in Sevastopol who had been quite cured by this
singular remedy.</p>
<p class="par">Immediately in front of the landing-place is the
caravanserai, a long, low building, with galleries. It contains a
number of small, empty rooms, of which any traveller may take
possession for a night. We watched the arrival of a large party, who
came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>in wearily with their tired horses and camels,
having come across the Great Steppe, or wilderness, that for a hundred
miles or more lies to the north of Eupatoria.</p>
<p class="par">Side by side with the mosque, the walls almost joining,
is the principal Greek church, and round it are the best houses, which
we, on landing, thought very wretched; but having been brought to a
proper degree of depression by a walk through the town, we found them
quite comfortable as we returned.</p>
<p class="par">It would be difficult to find a place more squalid and
filthy than this miserable little town. Eyes and nose are equally
offended; and after the delicate cleanliness so apparent in the Turks
and their houses, Eupatoria and its inhabitants appeared the more
revolting.</p>
<p class="par">Men, women, and houses looked as if water had been a
luxury unknown to them from the earliest days. Oil, oil
everywhere&mdash;on the walls, in the clothes, in the air, even on the
ground. One would have expected to see it running in the gutters, could
anything run here, but everything liquid seems to stagnate, and turn
into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>sticky mud. Nothing was clean except the
kittens, and they may fairly claim to be counted amongst the population
of the town, so numerous were they.</p>
<p class="par">The bazaars were better supplied than might have been
supposed from the poverty-stricken appearance of the place.</p>
<p class="par">The bread was fairly good, and fruit very abundant. The
melons, especially, were excellent, and exceedingly cheap. We bought
some of the finest in the market for little more than two copecks
(about a penny) apiece.</p>
<p class="par">The day following our arrival we went on shore about six
o&rsquo;clock, in order to have a long drive into the Steppe. Whilst
waiting for our conveyance we went into the Greek church, and found it
crowded with people, it being the Feast of the Assumption.</p>
<p class="par">The full dress of the Greek priests is very magnificent.
One of those now officiating had a robe of silver tissue, with a large
cape of crimson velvet, half covered with gold embroidery. The custom,
also, of wearing the hair long adds much to the picturesque appearance
of the Greek &ldquo;papas.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The youngest of the three priests had a singularly
beautiful face, in shape and colouring like one of Leonardo da
Vinci&rsquo;s pictures of Our Saviour. The hair, wavy and silky as that
of a woman, and of a reddish, or rather golden-brown shade, hung in
rich masses over his shoulders, nearly down to his waist.</p>
<p class="par">The congregation was composed principally of men of the
lower classes, dressed in the ordinary costume of Russian peasants.
This consists of a sheepskin coat, a cap of the same material, very
full cloth trousers, and great leather boots.</p>
<p class="par">Although well clad, and with no appearance of poverty
about them, yet there was in the attitude and bearing of these men an
expression of deep humility, almost amounting to slavishness, that was
painful to see. Very remarkable, also, was the utter joylessness of the
faces around. There was no lack of intelligence, but these poor people
looked as if the very power of being happy or cheerful had died away
within their hearts.</p>
<p class="par">Occasionally during the service they prostrated
themselves in the Turkish fashion, by touching the ground with their
foreheads; but for the greater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>part of the time they were
crossing themselves diligently.</p>
<p class="par">No man could have crossed himself less than two or three
hundred times during the hour we remained in the church.</p>
<p class="par">Before the service had quite concluded, a sound, as if a
lot of old saucepans had been dragged to the door, accompanied by the
stamping of horses and the shouts of men, announced that our carriage
had arrived, and on going out we found a wonderful-looking conveyance
awaiting us. A long box, something like an unpainted hearse, had been
fastened by bits of rope and bands of iron to a set of wheels which
looked as if they had originally belonged to a gun-carriage; and it was
evident that springs were a luxury not to be expected. There were no
seats, but some straw, covered by a couple of sheepskins, had been put
in for us to sit upon.</p>
<p class="par">We climbed up, and arranged ourselves as well as we
could, but with some dismal forebodings on the subject of fleas, which,
unhappily, were fully realised.</p>
<p class="par">We tumbled and bumped over a sort of track, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>passing through a wretched street of decayed
warehouses, and almost equally ruinous huts, and then by a row of
windmills, so small that they looked like children&rsquo;s toys, till
we came to the open country, or steppe.</p>
<p class="par">It would be difficult to imagine anything more desolate
than the arid plain that stretches beyond Eupatoria, on the north side,
as far as eye can reach.</p>
<p class="par">It is half marsh, half sand, and for many months during
the winter lies partially under water.</p>
<p class="par">Here and there may be seen a patch of reedy grass, like
an oasis in the desert. On one of these two Bactrian camels were
feeding, and their uncouth forms and awkward movements were very
appropriate adjuncts to the gloomy dreariness of the scene.</p>
<p class="par">Bactrian camels differ from those of Egypt and Syria in
having two humps instead of one; and being in general better bred, and
consequently swifter than the animals in the latter countries, are of
course more valuable.</p>
<p class="par">A drive of a few miles satisfied our curiosity
respecting the steppe. We might have journeyed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>on
for days and have still seen the flat, desolate plain stretching far,
far away with the same gloomy monotony of dreariness. So, finding that
the cramp was seizing us, and that our bones were decidedly aching from
the bumps and blows we got in consequence of the primitive construction
of our vehicle, we turned back towards the sea.</p>
<p class="par">Along the shore were still lying the remains of some of
the French vessels wrecked here during the storm of the 14th of
November, 1854, and a mast or two, sticking up from a sand-bank at no
great distance, showed where some other unfortunate ships had more
recently found a grave.</p>
<p class="par">We had heard that there was a Jewish synagogue here well
worth seeing, and also interesting, as being the favourite burial-place
of many Rabbis of the Russian Jews. So, leaving the carriage at the
entrance of the town, we dived into a perfect labyrinth of little, dark
streets, even more unsavoury than those whose acquaintance we had
already made.</p>
<p class="par">Our guide halted under an ancient archway, and ringing a
bell, in a few minutes the trap of a little grating was slipped aside,
and a tremulous old voice <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>asked who were the visitors, and
what they wanted. The answer being satisfactory, bolts were withdrawn
and chains let down, a small door opened, and we found ourselves in a
deliciously clean, shady court, made dark and cool by trellises covered
with vines, from which great bunches of rich purple grapes were hanging
in tempting profusion. In the corners stood pots of the sweet
clove-pink, and the sun&rsquo;s rays, softened by the shadowing
vine-leaves, fell upon the marble pavement, beneath whose slabs lay the
body of many a Rabbi well known in Jewish history. Some of those, who
were now resting in their last sleep in this quiet spot, had died the
death of martyrs in Poland and elsewhere, and, in secrecy and with much
difficulty, their poor remains had been brought here to lie in peace
amidst their brethren.</p>
<p class="par">The synagogue was a room about forty feet square. The
walls were ornamented with Hebrew sentences from the Old Testament, and
in numerous little niches around lay the Bibles and Talmuds of the
congregation. Before a screen at the upper end was a small table,
covered with a cloth that was a mass of gold, embroidery, and seed
pearls. On <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>either side were desks, on which lay the Books
of the Law, and above the screen stood the golden candlesticks with
their seven mystical branches. Ostrich eggs and crimson horse-tails
were suspended from the roof, as in a Turkish mosque, and the floor was
covered with an unusual number of magnificent Persian rugs, laid one
over the other.</p>
<p class="par">As we passed through some other small courts and
gardens, we saw several women peeping at us from behind the doors. At
length two or three gained courage enough to show themselves, and very
pretty they looked in their picturesque costume. They had white
chemises, with large loose sleeves, bound with red round the throat and
arms, and a broad border of the same colour on their short black
petticoats. They wore on their heads a little fez with a bright purple
tassel, and each fair Jewess had four or five thick plaits of hair
hanging down almost to her feet. We were lost in admiration at the
length and beauty of these tresses, but, alas! discovered that they
were heirlooms, not growing on the heads, but sewn on to the fezzes of
the wearers, and with care they may sometimes serve two, or even three
generations. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Jews, as a class, are sometimes said to be oppressed and
ill-treated in Russia, but certainly in Eupatoria they were the only
people we saw who were clean and thoroughly well dressed, and whose
houses appeared comfortable and comparatively free from oil.</p>
<p class="par">The wind favoured us, and we had an excellent run from
Eupatoria to Old Fort, where the English troops landed on the 14th of
September, 1854. As we were rowing on shore the breeze shifted, and we
suddenly found ourselves enveloped in a dense shower of locusts. The
flight was so enormous that it quite darkened the air, and explained
the meaning of a singular cloud we had been watching for some hours,
thinking, as it came up, that it must bode either thunder or heavy
rain.</p>
<p class="par">It was sufficiently disagreeable to have these revolting
animals falling upon one every second, but this annoyance was as
nothing compared with the horror of the smell that assailed us when we
came to the shore. Myriads of dead and dying locusts were lying in
masses upon the ground. The day was intensely hot, and the sun,
streaming upon the mass of decaying insects, seemed to draw a cloud of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>pestilential vapour from the ground, while every
now and then a puff of sickening miasma came from a little piece of
water close by, rightly called the Foetid Lake, from some peculiarity
of the mud on its banks.</p>
<p class="par">My curiosity was not strong enough to enable me to
endure the horrors of a walk over the dead and dying animals, so I fled
to the boat, and, under the protection of a thick cloak and huge
umbrella, waited there until the others had seen enough.</p>
<p class="par">For hours the yacht was passing through the swarm, or
detachments of it. Such numbers of the disgusting insects fell on the
deck that two men were constantly employed in sweeping them into the
sea. Every window, every crevice, was kept carefully closed, for fear
that one of them should get below. There is something inexpressibly
revolting about these horrid animals. They fly, they crawl, and they
cling, and, after having come in contact with them, we could well
understand what a frightful infliction the plague of them in Egypt must
have been. Wherever they pass they leave barrenness and pestilence. We
hoped the flight we had met might be driven out to sea. It was a very
large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>one, for long after we had passed through it, we
could see the dark cloud extending along the horizon like hills.</p>
<p class="par">Beyond Old Fort the country began to improve. The sandy
plain gradually changed into gentle undulations, then rose to
picturesque hills, and at last, in the distance, a range of fine
mountains came in sight. Here and there a few small farmsteads,
surrounded by patches of cultivated ground, showed that the soil was
more genial than that around Eupatoria and Old Fort.</p>
<p class="par">In the glow of a lovely sunset, the sea gently breaking
in little waves upon the beach, the lark singing above the corn-fields,
in all the quiet and repose of a summer evening, we came upon the scene
of the most awful strife and carnage the world has seen in modern
times.</p>
<p class="par">As we lay in towards the shore, on our right was the
steep bank up which the brave Zouaves forced their way; the pretty
grass-field beyond, where a flock of sheep were so peacefully feeding,
was the deadly slope where so many of the noble and gallant 23rd Welsh
Fusiliers died a soldier&rsquo;s death. That fearful day is now a story
of long ago&mdash;but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>what English heart can look upon
the field of Alma and remain unmoved?</p>
<p class="par">The chalk cliffs near the sea are about thirty feet
high, and are curiously intersected by strata of red gravel. As the sun
slowly sank, these cliffs caught his last rays, and were dyed so deep a
crimson that we could almost fancy the battle had but been to-day, and
that the long dark stains were indeed the blood so nobly shed by our
gallant soldiers.</p>
<p class="par">We hove-to opposite the mouth of the little river, and
sent a boat on shore to see if we could land, but a Cossack, who had
been suspiciously watching the movements of the yacht all day (and a
long hot ride he must have had), rode rapidly down to the beach, and,
pointing his lance in very warlike fashion at the men, clearly
demonstrated that no landing must be attempted. The boatswain, who
spoke Russ, tried to remonstrate, but an order had lately been sent
from Odessa, that no person should be allowed to land on the coast
without a permit, so, with our destination before us, we had to set
sail and depart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"

<h2 class="main">SEVASTOPOL.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The next morning, soon after six a.m., we were
awakened by the roar of cannon, and running on deck to ascertain the
cause, found that the yacht was dashing along under a fresh breeze, and
rapidly approaching the entrance to Sevastopol.</p>
<p class="par">Wreaths of smoke were curling round Fort Constantine. We
could hear the hissing of the shot as it fell into the sea, and such
warlike sights and sounds almost made one fancy we had come in time for
the siege; but drawing near, the ruins that lay around, the masts, and
the bits of wreck sticking up in all parts of the harbour (making the
navigation both difficult and dangerous), showed we had but arrived to
see the <i>effects</i> of war.</p>
<p class="par">Even after the lapse of so many years, the scene
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>of desolation was extraordinary. The forts are
not even in ruins. So completely have they been destroyed, that only
masses of broken stones show the sites where they once stood. On the
heights are rows of handsome houses, or palace-like barracks, still
roofless, the walls shattered, and grass growing thickly between the
stones.</p>
<p class="par">The Russians seem to have had as yet no heart or
inclination to attempt seriously the work of restoration. A few houses
have been made habitable, some rebuilt, but whole quarters have been
left as they were at the termination of the siege. In some streets,
where apparently a perfect storm of shot and shell must have descended,
the walls of the houses left are so shattered that it seems almost
unsafe to walk about amongst them&mdash;they look as if a gust of wind
must bring them down.</p>
<p class="par">The principal church of St. Nicholas has been restored,
and houses have been built for the governor, admiral, and principal
officials; but of the beautiful public buildings and magnificent
palaces of which Sevastopol was once so proud nothing now is left but
the scorched, battered, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>defaced skeletons. Some of these
poor remains still retain traces of their former grandeur. Here and
there a bit of tarnished gilding, pieces of what was once rich
sculpture, traces of painting, the remains of stone or marble
staircases, still cling to the crumbling walls. Never again, in all
probability, will this once beautiful city regain the prosperity and
position she enjoyed before the fatal war that brought about her
destruction.</p>
<p class="par">Sevastopol was the pet child of several successive
Emperors, and unheard-of were the sums expended, not only on the naval
and military defences of a place for many years deemed impregnable, but
also for the decoration and improvements of her streets and public
buildings.</p>
<p class="par">To insure the houses being well and handsomely built,
and to assist also many of the naval and military officials, whose pay
is generally so small that they can barely subsist upon it, the Russian
government had for many years adopted the following system:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The land, both in the town and immediately around it,
was Crown property. Supposing an officer wished to build a house, he
sent a plan of it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"
name="pb128">128</a>]</span>to the Minister of the Interior, and an
estimate made by the government architect. Should the plan be approved,
and if the house would cost, say, 20,000 roubles, the government would
advance at once 10,000 roubles, and in two years time 10,000 more. This
money was lent without interest for five years, but had then to be
repaid by instalments.</p>
<p class="par">Should the whole sum of 20,000 roubles not have been
repaid within ten years, the house then became the property of the
Crown. This regulation, however, was seldom carried into effect, and
the borrower was generally permitted to pay interest for the money
until he could pay off the principal. As the houses were large and let
in apartments, as in Paris, the rents obtained were in most cases far
greater than necessary to repay the interest of the money expended.</p>
<p class="par">In the old, merry days Sevastopol was a very gay place.
Being the principal port of the Black Sea, the Plymouth in fact of the
Empire of the Czar, it was the great rendezvous of the fleet, and a
large number of naval officers and their families were always resident.
The immense garrison also made an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>important addition to the
society, and many of the South Russian families passed their winter in
Sevastopol, the climate being much more temperate than at either Odessa
or Simpheropol.</p>
<p class="par">Sevastopol, therefore, was considered, after St.
Petersburg and Moscow, the gayest and most brilliant town in Russia.
Its nearness also to the imperial villa at Yalta made the official
appointments eagerly sought after.</p>
<p class="par">But these gay balls, dinners, concerts, &amp;c., are now
only things of the past. The inhabitants can be counted by tens instead
of by thousands, and but for the families of those whose duty obliges
them to remain, the town would speedily cease to be. Dull as Sevastopol
generally is, it was duller than usual during our stay, for several of
the principal officials had been summoned to Odessa to attend two of
the imperial princes. Those who remained, however, seemed as if they
could not be kind enough, or friendly enough, to travellers from a
country who a few years back had been so terrible an enemy.</p>
<p class="par">There has ever been such kind feeling and such
friendship between Russia and England that it must always be painful to
an Englishman to think <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>circumstances should have forced
us into a cruel war with an old and steady friend.</p>
<p class="par">The day after our arrival we got three droskies to take
us to the Redan and the neighbouring heights. Crimean droskies are like
very low gigs, and hold two persons besides the driver, who sits upon a
small box or perch high above the body of the carriage. One of the
horses is in shafts, with a wooden arch hung with bells over his head,
the other is in traces on the left side. When well driven this horse
canters while the other trots, and however rough and uneven the road,
the pace is generally tremendous.</p>
<p class="par">The drivers were strange wild creatures, with long
unkempt beards, and hair that flew out behind them like a cloud as we
raced along. They wore coarse frieze coats, with long full skirts
coming down to their heels, and loose trousers tucked into great
Wellington boots, so redolent of musk and train oil that every time
their owner kicked the plank beneath his feet, in his energy to
overcome some unusual difficulty, an odour was wafted to us that was
far from resembling those that come from Araby the Blest. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Our progress was both noisy and exciting. On coming to a
bad place the drivers stood up, stamped with excitement, shouting to
their team, and addressing them in a stream of terms both of endearment
and abuse. The horses tossed their heads as they struggled and plunged,
the bells jangling furiously, and we could only hold tight as the light
carriage bounded over hole or mound.</p>
<p class="par">Carriage-hire is dear, each drosky costing about one
rouble and a half an hour; a rouble is nearly 3s. 4d. in English
money.</p>
<p class="par">The dust during the summer in and about Sevastopol is
quite remarkable, and can be only equalled by the mud in winter. The
soil is principally of a description of chalk that rapidly pulverises
during dry weather, and equally rapidly dissolves during wet. The
result is that in summer the town and country seem wrapped in clouds of
fine penetrating dust, and during winter the mud is ancle-deep.</p>
<p class="par">Within ten minutes of our start we were as white as
millers, and half-choked besides, as, perfectly regardless of our
wishes and requests, the drivers occasionally amused themselves by
racing, or else <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>insisted upon keeping close to the wheels
of the preceding carriage.</p>
<p class="par">After passing through street after street of ruins, we
found ourselves in a narrow ravine immediately beneath the Redan, and
at about a quarter of a mile from the town came to the first or most
advanced English trench. Of course years have gradually levelled the
soil, and now it is like a small dry ditch, but even had the mound
raised been three times the height it now is, it seemed amazing that so
slight an amount of earth could have been sufficient to protect the
soldiers from the rain of shot so unceasingly poured from the town.
Even with gabions on the top, the men could not have stood upright in
the trench.</p>
<p class="par">About fifty yards up the valley was a mound of earth
with two &ldquo;dents&rdquo; in it. This had been an English battery of
two guns, and the dents marked the places where the cannon had stood.
Higher up was another trench, then another battery, and so on, until,
the defile making a turn, the town was no longer commanded.</p>
<p class="par">Now and then we passed a small enclosure surrounded by
rough walls, or came to a heap of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133"
href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>earth with a few stones piled
upon its summit. These are the resting-places of many of our soldiers.
There are no names, in a few more years even these slight traces will
be obliterated, and the earth, once so deeply dyed with their blood,
will give no token of the brave hearts she has taken to her bosom.
These humble graves, the only record of so many unknown but gallant
men, all of whom had died fighting for their country, appeal even more
powerfully to the feelings than the long line of grand monuments on
Cathcart&rsquo;s Hill, though many great and distinguished names are
recorded there.</p>
<p class="par">Many can understand and share Lord Nelson&rsquo;s
feelings when he exclaimed, &ldquo;A peerage, or Westminster
Abbey;&rdquo; but how hard to die for one&rsquo;s country, knowing that
that country will not even remember the name of its poor servant!</p>
<p class="par">After winding up the valley for another mile and a half,
we left the road, and ascending a little down or grass field found
ourselves within half a mile of the Redan. Strange to say, though we
had mounted to a considerable height, but very little of the town was
visible from the spot where we were. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Seen from the sea, Sevastopol appears to stand in an
amphitheatre of hills, that apparently command it on every side; but,
in fact, there are only two heights that really do so&mdash;namely,
those of the Malakoff and the Redan. The view was extensive, and we
could see, for a considerable distance inland, over an undulating but
now barren country. The ground around had been so torn and rent by the
iron storm of shot and shell, that it looked as if it had been badly
ploughed by awkward giants, but time has now covered the ugly wounds
with a soft vesture of grass and thyme. Nature has done all the
reparation that has been made. We could see no traces of cultivation in
any direction, neither were any cattle or sheep to be seen feeding on
the miles of short, sweet down grass that would have been so suitable
for them; but where war lays her destroying hand, the labours and
improvements of centuries are destroyed in as many hours.</p>
<p class="par">A sandy track led to the Redan, the ground at every step
giving more and more evidence of the deadly struggle that had taken
place. In every direction huge ragged holes and fissures showed where
mines had been sprung, and monstrous rents <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>in
the ground, close to the fort, marked where some battery had poured a
stream of fiery shot, that had torn its way through earth, and stone,
and iron with appalling strength.</p>
<p class="par">Bullets and pieces of shot and shell are still to be
found in abundance, and women and children are constantly employed in
turning over the earth in search of these relics, and also of the small
brass crosses, one of which is always worn by every Russian
soldier.</p>
<p class="par">Standing on the edge of the ditch, the desperate nature
of the attack could be better appreciated. The ditch was about fifteen
feet deep, with a tremendous <i lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i> at the
bottom, and the guns of the fort were so numerous that the embrasures
were not more than a few feet apart. It is difficult to imagine a more
appalling position than to have to lead troops on to such certain
death. Our guide, who had belonged to the Land Transport Corps, saw the
attack made.</p>
<p class="par">The most advanced English trench was about a hundred and
fifty feet from the Redan, and it was from here the final rush was
made. On came the officers closely followed by the devoted regiments,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>and through the deadly hail of shot and grape
that was pouring from the Russian guns, the attacking columns rushed up
the fatal slope. But few of these gallant men entered the breach, the
terrific fire mowed them down by hundreds, and in a few seconds the
ground was covered with the dead and dying. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said
our informant, &ldquo;could he forget the hideous yells, shouts, and
shrieks that filled the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The first man who raised the English standard on the
Russian bastion was Captain Robert Preston, but he had scarcely waved
it in the air when he fell, pierced by twenty wounds. Our guide saw him
fall, on a heap of dead Russians, with the gabions on fire by his
side.</p>
<p class="par">Inside the fort the number of mines that had been sprung
had so riddled the ground that much caution was required to avoid
falling into the great holes.</p>
<p class="par">The sun had now set, twilight in these countries is very
short, for darkness soon comes on, and just when the grey duskiness of
evening gave additional gloom to the dreary scene of desolation and
ruin around, quietly stealing from behind the broken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>wall
of the nearest graveyard came creeping a lean, savage jackal. So
noiseless and so stealthy were his movements, that at times his dark
grey form could scarcely be distinguished from the dark grey stones by
which he stole so cautiously. Breathlessly we watched the savage
creature as he prowled along. The wind blowing strongly towards us, for
a few minutes we were undetected, but very soon a slight rustle made by
one of the party betrayed our neighbourhood, and in a second, with a
vicious snarl and snap, the animal was bounding off, with long loping
strides, towards the open country. In wild countries troops of jackals
always form part of the camp-followers of a great army. As the vulture
and the crow scent carrion, so does the instinct of the jackal tell him
where human bodies are interred, and unless the surrounding walls are
high and strong, many a burial-place has been desecrated by these
savage and cowardly animals. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We started one fine, sunny morning, at eight
o&rsquo;clock, for a long expedition to Cathcart&rsquo;s Hill and St.
George&rsquo;s Monastery. We left the town by the valley beneath the
Redan, but instead of taking the turn to the left that leads to the
fort, followed the course of the defile until we arrived at some table
land, where are the remains of the English Picket House. Close by is
the burial-ground of the Light Division. It is surrounded by low but
well-built walls. Neglect, however, and the rapid growth of weeds have
made many of the inscriptions, and even some of the graves, invisible.
In the centre stands a pyramid, bearing inscriptions both in English
and Russ to the officers and men belonging to the Light Division. One
monument had the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>following words, deeply cut in the stone:
&ldquo;Sacred to the memory of the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and men of the 77th Regiment, who lost their lives in the service of
their country during the campaign in the Crimea. This monument is
erected by the officers of the Regiment, as a humble tribute of respect
to the fortitude and bravery of their fallen comrades.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Pushing aside the grass and rank weeds, we found the
names of many friends, and with the aid of parasols and sticks, cleared
some graves from the tangled growth of years, and planted upon them
tufts of sweet-scented thyme and a little blue flower very like the
forget-me-not. From some we gathered a few coarse wild-flowers, and
even blades of grass, to bear home to mothers whose hearts are still
aching for the brave young dead who have but a soldier&rsquo;s grave so
far from home and from those who loved them. Many we had known well, in
the brightest hours of their youth and happiness, were sleeping here in
bloody graves. No words can adequately express the depression of
spirits which must come after passing hours in going from burial-ground
to burial-ground, only to see where <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>those, once so loved
in life, so honoured in their death, now lie&mdash;uncared for,
unthought of&mdash;in cemeteries that, instead of being evidences of a
nation&rsquo;s gratitude and reverence, are now untended and forgotten,
a tangled mass of weeds, and but fit homes for the jackal and the
fox.</p>
<p class="par">Leaving the Woronzoff road on the right, we came to a
knoll, or patch of rising ground, from whence an excellent view of the
town can be had. It was here that the non-fighting visitors usually
took up their position, for not only could a good general view of the
camps and town be obtained, but, with glasses, it was easy to see the
people walking in the streets.</p>
<p class="par">The road passes by a small village, where, standing in
the midst of some neat enclosures, with a well-filled farmyard at its
rear, is a low one-storied house. This unpretending little building was
once the head-quarters of the English staff, and here poor Lord Raglan
breathed his last.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding the severe losses and sufferings that
were caused to its owners by their home and property being seized by
the enemy, Monsieur and Madame B&mdash;&mdash; receive with kindness
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>hospitality any English who may wander here. We
are, however, at present the only foreigners who have visited
Sevastopol this year.</p>
<p class="par">In a small sitting-room a marble slab has been let into
the wall, over the place where the bed stood on which Lord Raglan died.
In the wood of the folding doors are cut the names of Field-Marshal
Lord Raglan, General Simpson, and Sir William Codrington. The temporary
grave in which the body of the noble old soldier was placed previous to
its removal to England, has also been well cared for. Willows hang over
the spot, and it is surrounded by a border of rose-bushes and
flowers.</p>
<p class="par">A tale of the troubles caused by war is always sad to
hear, and the family, at whose hospitable board we were seated, had
been absolutely ruined by their losses, and were now attempting to
begin the world afresh; but though Monsieur B&mdash;&mdash; is an
energetic farmer and works, his wife says, early and late, he has
hitherto reaped but little reward for his toil. Life, commerce, energy,
have alike deserted Sevastopol, and there is but little or no market
either there or in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="par">Poor little Madame B&mdash;&mdash;, with tears in her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>pretty eyes, deplored in fervent language the
loss of her comfortable home. Her husband was with his regiment on the
north side, when the rapid approach of the allies obliged her and her
children to fly for safety to Simpheropol. She left a house, well,
almost luxuriously furnished, and returned at the end of the war to
find but bare walls&mdash;not even a chair had been left. The farm and
garden gone&mdash;gone also the woods and valuable vineyards, the very
roots of which had been torn up and burnt. Our graceful little hostess,
however, with a tender regard for the feelings of her stranger guests,
hastened to add that the ruin of the place was not owing to the English
army, whose generals had kindly striven to save and to spare as much as
possible, but to those human locusts, the Tartar camp-followers.</p>
<p class="par">From Cathcart&rsquo;s Hill we drove to Kerani, a
desolate little village lying amongst the hills near Balaclava. There
were about half-a-dozen half-ruined wooden hovels, and a couple of
better-class houses, although these were also built of wood. To one of
these we were most kindly welcomed by Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The long sloping roofs, weighted by large stones, and
the peculiarly small windows, only seen in stormy countries, showed how
severe the winters must sometimes be here, and we were told that,
though cold is seldom of long continuance, and though snow rarely
remains for many days upon the ground, yet the gales of wind during the
winter months are of extraordinary violence, the long narrow gullies
with which the hills are intersected acting as funnels, down which the
raging tempest hurries with increasing fury and strength. In general,
however, the gales, though severe, are short, and in the memory of man
no such terrible winters had been known as those experienced by our
troops during the two years they were in the Crimea. Never before had
such intense cold been known; never before had the storms been so
prolonged and incessant. Direct manifestations, it was believed by the
lower order of Russians, that Providence itself was against the
unrighteous invasion of the land.</p>
<p class="par">We had a pleasant luncheon at Colonel
S&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s, and the live stock of the yacht was increased
by the kind gift (rather to Mr. Harvey&rsquo;s horror) of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>pair of quite lovely geese. We had not believed
the usually despised goose could be so beautiful a bird. These geese
were as white as snow, had backs and wings covered with long curling
feathers like ostrich plumes, and had bright pink bills and feet; but
for their unfortunate voices they might have set up for swans. Our dear
birds, however, did not approve of being summarily torn from the
paternal pond and packed in a basket, so they hissed and cackled all
the rest of the day in a thoroughly goose-like and provoking
manner.</p>
<p class="par">From Kerani we went to St. George&rsquo;s
Monastery&mdash;a long low building, standing apparently in a flat,
ugly country; but on passing through an archway, and descending a few
steps, an enchanting view was before us.</p>
<p class="par">The convent is built upon the extreme edge of a steep
wooded cliff overhanging a little bay. Paths had been cut through the
wood, and wound down between trees and rocks to the verge of the sea,
where tiny waves were coming quietly in upon a shining beach, trickling
back amongst the many-coloured shells and stones with a pleasant
murmur, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>most refreshing on such a burningly hot day. But
the sun was now glowing with almost blinding heat upon this the western
side, so we retired into the interior of the building until the
intolerable glare should have somewhat subsided.</p>
<p class="par">There are now only five brethren of the order living at
St. George. Since the war the number has greatly diminished, and some
are required for another house at Simpheropol. We were invited to have
some tea, an offer we thankfully accepted, and while it was getting
ready were asked to pay a visit to the cells. They were fairly
comfortable, indeed better than may be found in many religious houses
in Italy and France, that have not so strict a rule as the Greek
convents.</p>
<p class="par">Each brother was provided with a table, a stool, some
boards on tressels for a bed, a mattress (certainly very thin), and a
blanket; but what can monks wish for more? In the Greek Church, the
severity of monastic life consists principally in the length and rigid
observance of the frequent fasts, and in the small amount of sleep that
is permitted. There is scarcely a religious house in which meat is ever
eaten, and twice a week, during the long fast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>of
Easter, only one meal a day is allowed, consisting of beans boiled with
oil.</p>
<p class="par">As there are no inns in this part of the world,
excepting in towns, monasteries answer the purpose, and though payment
is not permitted, each traveller, ere he departs, is expected to drop
an offering into the poor-box.</p>
<p class="par">While waiting for the tea, some water was brought from
the famous spring of St. George. It is celebrated for miles around, and
well deserves its fame. Fresh, sparkling, and cold as if iced, it was
really nectar. Well for us it was so, for we needed some little
compensation for the disappointment that awaited us with respect to the
much-wished-for, long-promised tea. The eagerly-expected beverage, when
it did at last arrive, was brought in tumblers, without either milk or
sugar, and being a very strong decoction of something bitter, between
sloes and haystalks, it was so like a horrid medicine called
&ldquo;black draught,&rdquo; that nothing but the strongest exertion of
good manners could enable one to swallow even a few drops.</p>
<p class="par">At six o&rsquo;clock we went into chapel for the Ave
Maria. The chapel is a neat little building, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>detached from the monastery, and has some
altar-pieces remarkably well painted. The pictures of the saints were
covered with plaques of gold and silver in <i>alto-relievo</i>, and had
glories of precious stones around their heads.</p>
<p class="par">The congregation was very limited, for it consisted of
only three brethren, the sacristan, and one old woman, but the service
was got over with wonderful speed, though with no apparent disrespect
of manner. Vespers over, we were shown the chapel. Behind the
altar-screen was an exceedingly good picture of The Crucifixion, but as
it was in a part of the building that women are not allowed to profane
by their unholy presence, my sister and I had to remain on the other
side of the altar, the monks most good-naturedly drawing aside
curtains, and trying to give us as good a view as possible.</p>
<p class="par">The evening had by this time become cool and pleasant,
so we strolled down the cliffs to look at the ancient chapel, the
hanging gardens, and the renowned spring. Excepting its antiquity, the
former possesses no interest; it is a very small stone building,
supposed to have been erected by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>Genoese when they
occupied this country, but both in form and decoration it is remarkably
simple.</p>
<p class="par">The stream poured forth from the rock with delicious
freshness, dashing, in a series of tiny cascades, from terrace to
terrace, ever sprinkling with a shower of brilliant drops the mosses
and tender ferns that grew on its banks, until, on reaching the good
monks&rsquo; gardens, it flowed decorously through appointed channels.
Then, its duties over, it gave one glad bound, as a miniature
waterfall, over the rocks into the sea, and was lost in the embrace of
its mighty mother. The terrace-gardens are beautifully kept, for the
monks labour in them unceasingly. The good fathers are the principal
doctors of the district, and grow, therefore, not only vegetables for
their own use, but most of the plants and herbs required for medicinal
purposes.</p>
<p class="par">It was late before we returned to Sevastopol, but the
drive back in the cool night air was very refreshing. As we descended
the heights into the town, we could see the bright lights of our
many-coloured little Turkish lanterns shining a cheerful welcome to us
from the yacht. It is worth while to feel very tired, in order to
experience the inexpressible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>feeling of comfort that comes over
one when, on getting on board, we find the tea-table invitingly
prepared on deck, the samovar bubbling merrily under the teapot, the
little kitten ready for a game of play, and everything speaking of the
snugness and rest of home.</p>
<p class="par">The country immediately around Sevastopol looks rather
pretty, and is pleasant enough in fine weather. The air on the heights
is fresh and invigorating, and the clearness of the atmosphere gives a
charm to the distant views both over sea and land. A very few
hours&rsquo; rain, however, makes the place quite detestable, for it is
impossible to move out, either in the town or beyond it, without having
to wade through a perfect slough of sticky white mud. The misery and
illness that must have prevailed in the camps, after days of continued
down-pour, can be easily imagined.</p>
<p class="par">Our first visit to Marshal Pelissier&rsquo;s
head-quarters was made on one of these melancholy days. A Scotch mist,
that had been driven in from the sea, gradually changed into a steady,
soaking rain, but we were too far from home to turn back, and being
fortunately well cloaked and shod, in forlorn procession <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>we
waded through puddles and mud from graveyard to graveyard. To the
credit of the French nation, they are far better tended than ours.
Still the scene was gloomy enough to suit the gloomy day. The huts,
formerly inhabited by the troops, have fallen into ruins, and the wood
is rotting on the ground. Here and there are huge mounds of broken
bottles and other refuse, and near them again are great pits, where
infected clothing, &amp;c., were burnt during the time the cholera was
raging. The French head-quarters seem to have been very well placed,
for though on a commanding height, they must have been in a great
measure protected from the cruel north wind that blew with such bitter
severity into the English tents on Cathcart&rsquo;s Hill.</p>
<p class="par">Even black clouds and depressing rain could not make us
insensible to the beauty of the valley of Tchernaia. It lies deep
amongst rocks, with a fine range of chalk hills in the distance. The
long white lines on their rugged sides looked like snow whenever a
straggling ray of light fell upon them through the dark and heavy mass
of clouds. Quite at the upper end of the valley, where it turns to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>right towards Balaclava, are two low hills,
covered with the ruins of Sir Colin Campbell&rsquo;s camp. The long
flat piece of ground beneath these will be ever memorable as the scene
of the famous charge of cavalry. The little plain forms a sort of
amphitheatre, as it is partly surrounded at one end by a series of
hillocks or rising ground. On these commanding positions were posted
the Russian guns. Even an inexperienced eye could see at a glance that
the devoted regiments must have been rushing to certain death. It seems
marvellous that men can be so trained to passive obedience, that,
without a murmur, they hurry to their doom. Every officer, at any rate,
was probably aware that the heroic effort could but be a useless
sacrifice of human life. What must have been the agony of those who
were forced to look on at such frightful and unnecessary carnage,
powerless to prevent, and powerless to aid?</p>
<p class="par">Balaclava is a quaint little place, completely shut in
by hills and rocks. The entrance to the harbour from the sea is very
difficult to find even when quite close to it, so curiously does the
channel twist and turn about. It must have been once a better-class
village than any we had yet seen, for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>church, though in a
dilapidated state, is large, and the houses, though partly in ruins,
are of good size. Some have been repaired, and most are inhabited, but
everything speaks of ruin and discouragement. The landing-place is
rotting in the water, the warehouses made by the English are rotting on
the shore, and the dirty, dreary-looking people seem as if they were
decaying away in their poverty and hopelessness.</p>
<p class="par">Drinking is unhappily the prevailing vice in the Crimea.
We rarely went on shore without seeing several tipsy men. Towards
evening one generally meets wives and daughters dutifully wheeling
their husbands and fathers home in barrows. Yesterday we met a
procession of five being thus brought back in triumph from some
prolonged carouse. To the credit of the fair sex, it is but just to say
we have not seen one woman so degradingly overcome.</p>
<p class="par">The Russian women we have hitherto seen, though they
cannot be called pretty, have generally very pleasant faces. Their
voices are sweet and low, and the gentleness of their manner is very
prepossessing. It is impossible, however, not to feel that so much
timidity probably originates in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>harsh treatment they
experience in their homes, for the men, though humble and cringing when
addressing their superiors, are coarse and boorish to their inferiors.
These observations, of course, only refer to the lower classes. Amongst
the higher ranks, Russians of both sexes are quite remarkable for their
charm of manner and peculiar talents for society. The extraordinary
kindness we received from every family whose acquaintance we made
during our stay in the Crimea, quite endeared these kind people to us,
and personal experience enables us to say that Russian friendship does
not limit itself to charming manners alone.</p>
<p class="par">During our stay in Sevastopol, we became well acquainted
with several of the ladies who had remained in the town during the
siege. With the exception of one, all were wives or daughters of
officers in command, and who, with noble devotion, had refused to leave
their relations in the hour of danger. With unwearied zeal they
laboured in the hospitals, for, notwithstanding every effort, the
amount of attendance was lamentably deficient, and it was only possible
to provide for the more pressing need of the sufferers. All unite in
saying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>that the courage and fortitude of these ladies
were beyond praise. Many of them were quite young girls, but,
regardless of personal danger, they not only visited the hospitals, but
wherever illness or suffering required their presence these true
Sisters of Mercy were to be found. Death was ever before them, for who
could tell where or when would come the fatal shot? Day and night
shells were exploding in the devoted town. No spot was safe. When
sleeping in their homes, or praying in their churches, the fiery shot
might come crashing through the walls, dealing death and destruction
around. The narrow escapes related to us might fill a volume. One lady
had barely left the side of a wounded man, when a shot came through the
roof, instantly terminating the sufferings of the patient, and injuring
another in a neighbouring bed. One charming young girl, Mademoiselle
Androvna R&mdash;&mdash;, daughter of a general commanding a division,
had been in Sevastopol from the beginning of the siege until the end.
She was an only daughter, but her father and two brothers were
soldiers, and she remained with them to be, as they said, &ldquo;their
guardian angel.&rdquo; Although so many <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>years have now
elapsed, Androvna was strongly moved as she spoke of the anguish of
that terrible time. Parting almost daily, in ignorance as to whether
they should ever meet again, when again they met the little family felt
as if it were impossible they could all be much longer spared.
Sometimes a brother would have to proceed to an advanced post, and then
it might be days before they would know whether he was amongst the
living or the dead.</p>
<p class="par">One day, as Androvna was on her way to the hospital, she
met the sad procession of the wounded as they were carried in, and
found her youngest brother amongst the number; but the young man,
though he bears the marks of a fearful sword-cut across the face, and
has lost an arm, still lives, to love and cherish his devoted sister,
who nursed him through his sufferings with the tenderest care. Who
could think of personal danger when in such agony of anxiety for loved
ones, who were hourly exposed to far greater peril? So great was the
strain upon the nerves, that Androvna says she believed she should have
gone mad but for the supporting duty she felt it to attend the sick and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>wounded in the hospitals. By the bedside of
these poor sufferers self was for a time forgotten, and when she could
occasionally creep away to some neighbouring church, and on her knees
before her patron saint lay down her burden of sorrow and anxiety, then
peace and courage returned to her heavily-laden heart.</p>
<p class="par">She had, however, personally some narrow escapes. One
day, for instance, she was sitting in her room, with a pet dog lying at
her feet, when a shot came crashing through part of the house. The
little animal at her side was crushed to death by a falling piece of
wood, but the young girl happily escaped with a few slight bruises.

<h2 class="main">VALLEY OF TCHERNAIA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Not being at all satisfied with only having seen
the fair valley of Tchernaia in the gloom of rain and wind, we resolved
to try whether the glow of a fine summer day would not heighten its
charms<span class="corr" id="xd21e1663" title="Not in source">.</span>
One warm sunny morning, therefore, we put a basket of provisions and a
Russian dictionary in the yacht&rsquo;s cutter, and set off to
breakfast under the trees in a pleasant grass field beyond Inkerman.
The wind was contrary, so we had to row across the harbour, and for
about a mile up the river Tchern&eacute;; it then became favourable,
and strong enough to enable us to stem the little current, so, setting
a sail, we glided up the stream most pleasantly and rapidly.</p>
<p class="par">Gr&egrave;be, divers, and other water-fowl were
continually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>darting in and out of the masses of reeds that
grew along the banks, and at a sudden turn of the river a great eagle,
probably disturbed at his morning meal, rose slowly in the air, and
sailed away majestically towards the mountains.</p>
<p class="par">It was very early; the morning breeze was deliciously
cool and fresh, and as we lazily reclined on our comfortable seats,
listening to the soft sound of the water as it rippled against the bows
of the boat, or to the merry voices of the children as they chattered
to their favourite Domenico, it seemed as if life could offer nothing
pleasanter than to be thus gliding away in the summer sunshine towards
unknown scenes and beauties. Whatever might have been the worthy
Domenico&rsquo;s faults with respect to his masters, he was admired and
adored by every child who came near him.</p>
<p class="par">He had an art, quite peculiar to himself, for turning
everything he saw into something not intended by nature. Leaves,
flowers, sticks, stalks, became astonishing musical instruments after
passing through his cunning hands, and he would weave rushes, leaves,
and flowers into garlands, baskets, and a variety of pretty things,
with a rapidity and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span>skill that was quite marvellous, and of
course to the intense delight of the little folk around him. His pipes
and whistles, also, blew better and with greater shrillness than any
pipes and whistles that ever were known. Should occasion require he
could be an admirable cook; he could sing buffo songs with a talent
worthy of San Carlino itself; he could make clothes; he could improvise
clever verses; but unfortunately his inspirations would come to him at
unlucky moments, and while he was meditating a stanza more sublime than
usual a pile of plates or dishes would fall from his hands, and his
soaring spirit would be brought back to earth by an energetic
remonstrance on his carelessness.</p>
<p class="par">Happily he had not been in a poetic vein when he packed
the breakfast basket. The only thing omitted was some fruit, a want
that was soon supplied, for we passed a small house where the trellises
were absolutely laden with grapes, and we bought a large basket of them
for something under half a rouble.</p>
<p class="par">We continued our course up the river, passing between
water-meadows that had quite a park-like appearance from some fine old
trees that had happily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>escaped destruction. The many
ranges of hills also that could be seen as the valley opened were very
beautiful, for though hardly lofty enough to deserve the name of
mountains, the line of the more distant was rugged and bold, and in the
clear atmosphere tier upon tier could be seen, till the last faded away
in the blue distance.</p>
<p class="par">While we went to look at the ruined village of Inkerman
the sail was taken in, and as, owing to the large beds of rushes, the
stream was rapidly narrowing, we took to the oars again, until we
arrived opposite a small church and a few little houses that had been
hewn out of the cliff itself.</p>
<p class="par">The Tchern&eacute; divides here into several channels,
all too shallow for the boat, so we landed, and establishing ourselves
under some large trees, found a pleasant shelter from the sun, whose
rays had now become both fierce and overpowering. We spread our
breakfast on the grass, close to a delicious little ford, where the
water, quite put out of temper by the impeding stones, dashed and
tossed itself about in sparkles of brilliant rage. At length, throwing
itself down in a fierce little set of passionate cascades, it recovered
its calmness, and quietly subsided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>into the gentle stream
beneath. Can anything be more beautiful than such a stream? and what
delight greater than to rest thus under the shadow of great trees,
watching the sunshine as it plays on bank, and tree, and meadow, and to
know also one is far away from the working, weary troubles and
pleasures of the world?</p>
<p class="par">Seated on the warm, dry turf, we passed a couple of
hours very luxuriously, and somewhat idly. In fact, some of the party
indulged in a little slumber, a weakness quite to be forgiven, for the
day and place seemed alike made for repose. Not a breath stirred the
air, the leaves hung motionless on the trees, the bees hummed drowsily
among the flowers. The very birds were silent, the reed-sparrow alone
sending forth her monotonous piping note from some neighbouring bushes,
and the tinkling sound of the falling water made the most soothing
music imaginable. However, after a time we crossed the stream by means
of the little ford, and ascended the cliff to the church and village;
but church and houses were alike deserted. The door of the former was
locked and the houses were empty. Not a soul was to be seen anywhere.
We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>hunted about some time in hopes of finding the
key&mdash;for we had been told the chapel was well worth seeing, and
contained some curious old pictures&mdash;but in vain. The door was so
old and shaky that a vigorous blow would have broken it open, but not
thinking so felonious a mode of entrance suitable to the character of
the edifice, we walked back towards Inkerman by a path that gave us
beautiful views of the valley and mountains.</p>
<p class="par">The village of Inkerman no longer exists; a few
blackened walls alone mark its site.</p>
<p class="par">The battle was fought on the rising ground immediately
above the valley, and the earth still retains many memorials of the
bloody strife. Half buried in the soil, close to a low wall, we found
part of a broken sword; and any number of flattened bullets, buttons,
and portions of soldiers&rsquo; decorations could be easily had by
digging up the earth with parasol handles or sticks. On the highest
point has been placed a simple stone monument to the memory of all the
combatants who fell in that terrible struggle. English, French, and
Russians there share alike in the honour of that fatal day; and truly a
soldier&rsquo;s glory seems but a very little thing. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A short walk along the rising ground brought us to all
that is now left of the Malakoff. There are two ditches round it, but
neither of them is as deep as that which surrounds the Redan. The fort
itself, however, is very much larger, and in the centre are the ruins
of a low, flat tower. It was originally bomb-proof, but the French blew
it up when they obtained possession, and now barely half of the
building remains standing.</p>
<p class="par">The Malakoff so completely overlooks and commands the
town that even the non-combatant can perceive how useless must have
been any attempt to hold Sevastopol when once this, the key as it were
to the position, was in possession of the allies. Those who held the
Malakoff and the Redan had virtually Sevastopol, for shot and shell
from these forts could be poured like hail into the devoted town. These
two great outposts lost by the Russians, all further struggle on their
part must have been hopeless.</p>
<p class="par">Count K&mdash;&mdash; tells us that in fact Prince
Menschikoff had resolved to evacuate the town, and retire to the north
side, when the Quarries and the Mamelon had fallen into the hands of
the allies; and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span>would have done so before the attack on the
Malakoff was made, but for positive orders from St. Petersburg to hold
the town as long as possible.</p>
<p class="par">As far as we could judge, the general opinion amongst
the Russian officers was that the chief error Russia committed was in
allowing the allies to land undisturbed. Probably subsequent events
confirmed their views, but all seemed to think, had the French and
English met with a vigorous resistance when they disembarked,
Sevastopol would never have been invested. Unhappily for them, the
higher authorities at St. Petersburg were so firmly convinced that
Sevastopol and her forts were impregnable, that it was hoped, could the
allies be led on to make an attack upon the outworks, that not only
would they be repulsed, but that the annihilation of the whole invading
army would be the necessary consequence. Those generals who knew the
place, and who had some doubts as to the &ldquo;impossibility&rdquo; of
taking it from the land side, were not listened to. Any attack from the
sea must have been in vain.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding the kindness of our
friends&mdash;notwithstanding the fineness of the weather (for we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>had but few rainy days during the many weeks we
passed at Sevastopol), we longed to leave the place. Words cannot
adequately express the profound gloom and depression that weigh down
the spirits after any lengthened residence in the town of death. At
first, the great interest of seeing a place become so famous in
history, the excitement of visiting spot after spot renowned for deeds
of chivalrous daring unequalled in modern times, support the mind; but,
after a time, the one story told by every house, by every field, by
every grave&mdash;of untimely death, of man&rsquo;s love of
destruction, and of man&rsquo;s lust for blood&mdash;oppresses the
heart with a weight of sadness that becomes almost unendurable.</p>
<p class="par">Our favourite walk on many a bright summer&rsquo;s
evening was to stroll up to the Redan, and there we would seat
ourselves on a little grassy mound, the last resting-place probably of
a dead man, and gaze on the destroyed city below.</p>
<p class="par">The larks would be singing gaily over our heads, the
crickets chirping around; but if we pushed away the grass, or disturbed
the earth ever so little, how many records would meet the eye of the
deadly strife that had raged on the very spot where we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>were
now so quietly seated, while the extraordinary, almost awful silence of
the great city made one indeed feel that it was now but a city of
tombs.</p>
<p class="par">A little below us, on the right, stand the once lordly
Alexandra barracks&mdash;a building at one time unequalled of its kind
in grandeur and extent. Now the bare walls alone remain; the sky can be
seen through the long lines of windows. In lieu of roof, a few
blackened rafters project here and there, like monstrous gibbets, and
the masses of <i lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</i> around show how thoroughly
the work of destruction has been carried out.</p>
<p class="par">It is beyond measure depressing to walk through miles of
ruined streets; and, if so painful to the stranger, how heartbreaking
must it be to Russians, to see beautiful buildings, once the pride of
the country, hopelessly defaced and destroyed.</p>
<p class="par">The water-gate by which we land when coming from the
yacht must once have been a great ornament to the beautiful town, for
it is still lovely even in its ruin. It resembles the colonnade of an
ancient Greek temple, and is approached by a broad flight of shallow
steps. These, however, as well as the fine mosaic pavement, have been
broken and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>defaced, the roof has been battered in by
shells, the statues have been overthrown and broken, and scarcely a
column remains uninjured.</p>
<p class="par">Near this gate is the opera-house, or rather what is
left of it. It was formerly a large building with a long Greek
fa&ccedil;ade; but the walls are now shattered, and blackened by fire,
and the columns and decorations lie broken on the ground.</p>
<p class="par">The hospital is almost the only place that has not
suffered severely from the effects of the fiery hail that was so
incessantly pouring into the town. A flag showed where the unhappy
wounded were lying, and as far as possible the building was spared by
the besiegers; still its scorched and blackened sides and some yawning
holes tell that it did not altogether escape.</p>
<p class="par">Near it is a small chapel, now almost a ruin, a sad
memento of the sufferings of some of our poor fellows. Towards the
latter end of the siege, space, air, attendants, and surgical aid were
all lamentably inefficient to supply even the pressing needs of the
masses of wounded who were brought in.</p>
<p class="par">During the last few days also the confusion that reigned
in the town almost overcame discipline. No <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>sooner was the evacuation decided upon than
orders were given that, not only were the Russian wounded to be
conveyed immediately to the north side, but that all valuables that
could not be removed at the same time were to be burnt during the last
night, not only to prevent them from falling into the hands of the
enemy, but that the smoke should conceal the movements of the Russians;
for this reason also many portions of the town were set on fire. It may
easily be imagined, therefore, that there was but little time or
attention given to the unhappy wounded of the enemy who were to be left
behind; so, when the allies entered the deserted city, terrible were
some of the scenes that met their eyes. In this very chapel a harrowing
sight was beheld, for many of our poor countrymen were lying here
unheeded and untended, yet alive, with the dead in heaps around
them.</p>
<p class="par">The harbour of Sevastopol is supposed to be unequalled
for size, depth of water, and security. It very much resembles Plymouth
in the number of arms that branch off from the main channel. The
entrance is so broad and easy of access that vessels can run in for
shelter with almost any wind, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"
href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>when inside the forts the
various channels are so completely landlocked that ships can lie in
perfect safety whatever sea may rage outside.</p>
<p class="par">The navigation within is, however, now somewhat
difficult, as the Russians sank nearly all the vessels then in port
when the English fleet appeared before Sevastopol, and though most of
the wrecks have been raised, still enough remain to require skilful
pilotage to avoid the hidden dangers.</p>
<p class="par">The only cheerful place in all Sevastopol (out-of-door
cheerfulness, that is&mdash;not the many friendly houses that were
always open to us) was a small promenade, consisting of the ghost of
once beautiful pleasure-gardens, where the band played on fine
evenings.</p>
<p class="par">Here the few people left in Sevastopol would assemble at
sunset to listen to the excellent music and enjoy the cool evening air.
As night came on the scene would be very pretty. Darkness hid the ruins
around, so that the stars seemed only to shine on glistening white
monuments; the lights from the vessels in the harbour quivered like
lines of silver as they were reflected in the gently rippling water;
and when at last the whole glory of heaven was unfolded, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>the
dark-blue arch above seemed one dazzling array of brilliant stars.</p>
<p class="par">Those who have not seen them can form no idea of the
glorious beauty of the nights in these southern countries. The stars do
not twinkle, they blaze with bright silver light, and the eye in vain
endeavours to penetrate the glittering maze of which the heavens seem
formed.</p>
<p class="par">We find that this summer is considered at Sevastopol
rather hotter than the average, but we have seldom found the heat very
oppressive. The sun is powerful during the day, and often beats
fiercely upon the dry, parched soil. It is well therefore, if possible,
to avoid exposing oneself to the great heat of midday; but at sunset
the fresh sea-breeze always sets in, and the nights are cool and
invigorating.</p>
<p class="par">Amongst the many advantages yachtsmen enjoy over
travellers by land is the inestimable one of being nearly always sure
of a breeze at night, and none but those who have travelled much in
warm climates can tell how great that blessing is. Fatigue and heat
during the day can well be borne when one is sure of a quiet and
refreshing sleep. Another comfort also is comparative freedom from
mosquitoes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>and flies. How often when we have been doomed to
spend the night in some wretched inn or house, half-stifled by the heat
and bad smells, tormented beyond endurance by swarms of mosquitoes,
sand-flies, fleas, or perhaps worse, have we sighed for the little
cabins with their comfortable elastic mattresses, the fresh clean
sheets, and the cool night wind that would have been fanning us as we
rocked in our dear <i>Claymore</i>!</p>
<p class="par">Having once found ourselves in Malta during the hot
months of July and August, and having felt great compassion for the
unfortunate English soldiers as they marched up and down, under a
blazing sun, in all the misery and magnificence of the tight regulation
scarlet coat, with their throats braced up by a stiff collar, we much
admired the simple and comfortable uniform worn during summer by the
Russian troops. The men have a complete suit of grey cotton, with
peaked caps of the same material. The officers wear white jean, with a
band of scarlet round their caps, and sometimes a sash of the same
colour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Leaving Sevastopol one afternoon, a favourable
breeze carried us rapidly back to the Alma, and being now provided with
the necessary permit, we could land without danger of being impaled by
our enemy, the Cossack. We had also brought a letter of introduction to
Count B&mdash;&mdash;, a neighbouring proprietor, and, having sent it
to the village, we landed, and strolled along the beach, looking at the
heights the Zouaves had climbed.</p>
<p class="par">Count B&mdash;&mdash; speedily arrived, kindly answering
the letter in person, and bringing his carriage with him; so in a few
minutes we found ourselves seated behind two spirited little Tartar
horses, and away we went across the plain, perfectly regardless of the
absence of road. We passed several large stack-yards, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>full
of substantial ricks of hay and corn, where wild-looking Tartars were
thrashing out the grain&mdash;a simple process, accomplished by
fastening heavy blocks of wood to Tartar ponies, who were driven at
full gallop round and round the enclosure.</p>
<p class="par">The women wore their long hair in innumerable plaits,
hanging below their fez caps, and showed their Mohammedan tendencies by
partly veiling their faces as we passed. Feminine curiosity made them
peep at us from sheltered corners, though they seldom ventured to show
themselves completely.</p>
<p class="par">We turned into one of these farmyards, and found
ourselves in front of a little one-storied house, standing near a mass
of blackened ruins. Here we were most kindly received by Madame
B&mdash;&mdash; and a large family party, consisting of an aunt,
Mademoiselle M&mdash;&mdash;, a sister-in-law, two young ladies,
several children, and three gentlemen. Most of the party talked French,
and we were welcomed with charming kindness.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after our arrival tea was proposed, which, thanks
to the universal samovar, is almost always good in Russia. This time
the pleasant meal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>seemed doubly excellent, for, besides
grapes and water melons, there was a great bowl of cream, a luxury we
had not seen for a long time. Milk, as well as butter, is almost
unattainable in Sevastopol. The evening, though pleasant, was very
warm, so we were delighted to see that, instead of being prepared in
the little house, the hospitable tea-table was spread in the farmyard,
and there we sat, surrounded by cows, chickens, turkeys, and dogs, in
quite a patriarchal fashion, and enjoying ourselves greatly, for the
charming family with whom we were had the rare art of viewing
everything <i>en rose</i>, and while bearing their reverses with
dignified simplicity, yet took whatever little pleasure came in their
way with hearty and unaffected delight.</p>
<p class="par">Milking was going on, and noticing the beauty of the
cows, of which there were about twenty, we asked our hostess how much
milk they gave a day. She did not know, nor did any one, she said, keep
an account, for there is a superstition in the Crimea that should the
milk be measured the cows immediately become dry.</p>
<p class="par">We were kindly pressed to remain the night, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>we wished to return to the children, who had
been left on board the yacht. Besides, the house seemed so <i>very</i>
small, compared with the party already assembled, that we could
scarcely believe in the &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; of our being taken
in, whatever good-will there might be. We looked around, thinking there
must be some other house besides the very little one before us, but no,
nothing was to be seen but some Tartar huts, a few cow-hovels, and the
blackened ruins. So, with many thanks, we adhered to our original
intention, and then the greater part of the party proposed to accompany
us to the sea-shore.</p>
<p class="par">A large, powerful horse&mdash;a fine creature, but of a
fiery and impetuous nature&mdash;was with some difficulty harnessed to
a lofty gig, or &ldquo;heavenly chariot,&rdquo; into which I was
invited to mount. I did so, though, it must be confessed, with some
inward trepidation. In another moment our hostess was by my side, and
the fiery steed stood on his hind legs, as if he meant to
&ldquo;pose&rdquo; for ever as a statue for a &ldquo;horse
rampant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The young ladies, without any preparation, jumped on two
Tartar ponies; the rest of the party got into the other carriage. Our
energetic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>animal condescended to come down on his
forelegs, and, with a bound that almost took away my breath, off we
set&mdash;&ldquo;over brook, over byre&rdquo;&mdash;going across
country in the dark in the most astonishing fashion. To the very last
moment that fiery steed acted well up to his character; snorting,
plunging, and exerting himself most unnecessarily when any obstruction
came in his way. However, the fair charioteer, twisting the reins twice
round her hands, seemed fully equal to her task, and so away we went,
with glorious indifference to holes, mounds, or other little
impediments.</p>
<p class="par">The young ladies rode admirably. It could have been no
easy matter, and needed no little courage, to sit so steadily,
galloping at such a headlong pace, on a dark night, over rough ground
full of holes. However, we all arrived quite safely at the sea-shore,
and found our kind friends had brought us a supply of vegetables,
fruit, butter, and cream that made us rich for many days.</p>
<p class="par">When we rejoined our hospitable entertainers the
following morning the mystery of the sleeping accommodation was
explained. The little house only possessed two rooms divided by a
passage. All the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span>men slept in one room, the ladies had the
other; the governess being the best off, as she had a shelf to herself
in the passage. These kind people had really intended to share their
house with us, and proposed to give us one room and the passage, taking
the little governess into their already crowded room, and sending the
luckless men to find shelter where they could.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Heavenly Chariot&rdquo; was again made ready,
the mighty steed being more frisky than ever, as he felt the cheerful
influence of the fresh morning air, and after breakfast we all, some in
carriages, some on horseback, went to visit the field of the battle of
the Alma.</p>
<p class="par">Standing immediately beneath the Heights they appear
exceedingly steep, and difficult to climb, especially one would think
when exposed to a galling fire, but this very steepness proved the
salvation of the Zouaves.</p>
<p class="par">Once arrived at the foot of the cliffs, they were
<i>within</i> the range of the Russian guns, and these active fellows,
who climb like cats, were speedily at the top, and engaged in a
hand-to-hand combat with their foe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Our host, who had been on Prince Menschikoff&rsquo;s
staff, said that the Russians committed two fatal mistakes early in the
day.</p>
<p class="par">In his opinion the Russian guns should have opened fire
when the allies were crossing the river, and when their line
consequently was somewhat broken and disorganised. Unhappily, there was
difference of opinion and dissension amongst the Russian generals, and
therefore, marvellous to relate, no very precise orders were issued on
the important morning, so the favourable moment was lost.</p>
<p class="par">Deeming, also, their position impregnable, the Russians
were probably paralysed by the suddenness and vigour of the attack.</p>
<p class="par">Another almost equally fatal error was committed later
in the day. Several Russian regiments, instead of waiting to receive
the enemy on the commanding position they occupied on the Heights,
rashly descended to a sort of second terrace, a few feet below the
summit of the cliff; a most disastrous move on their part, for when the
Zouaves and light infantry swarmed up the rocks the miserable Russians
were bayoneted and cut down without a chance of retreat. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In fact most accounts tend to show that want of
organization, and the want of supreme military power on the spot,
contributed quite as much as the vigour of the attack to the loss of
the battle of the Alma, and the subsequent fall of Sevastopol.</p>
<p class="par">The Russians do full justice to the dauntless courage
and brilliant military talents of their foes, but the destruction of
Sevastopol lies heavy on their hearts, for the higher classes think her
fall was as much brought about by faults at home as by the intrepid
valour of the besiegers.</p>
<p class="par">In the early part of the war, intrigues, it is said,
were rife at the Russian Court, and the plans of the Crimean generals
were constantly interfered with and made of no effect by contradictory
orders from St. Petersburg. It was believed by the Emperor that the
garrison in Sevastopol was so immense that in itself it formed a large
and efficient army. It was believed that stores and all other
requisites were there in such abundance that the town was capable of
sustaining unassisted a protracted siege of even years, whereas so
great had been the venality practised that many regiments, supposed to
be fully manned, barely existed but in name. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">So far from being able to support a long siege, the vast
store-houses were more than half empty, and with respect even to
ammunition and arms the supply was lamentably inadequate. It is said
also that some of the cannon and shells were made of <i>wood</i>.</p>
<p class="par">When all the present generation has passed away, and
when the history of the Crimean war will only be classed among the
histories of the past, many who read the story will feel a deep
compassion for the mighty Emperor whose heart broke when he at length
knew the fatal truth. His cherished town&mdash;his impregnable
fortress&mdash;the pride of Russia&mdash;the key-stone, as it were, to
all his ambitious projects, must fall into the hands of the enemy for
want of troops, food, ammunition&mdash;for want of the very things with
which he supposed it had been so well supplied. Supplies were sent,
troops were sent, but in what condition could they arrive after having
traversed a country the width of Europe, in the depth of winter,
without railways, and nearly without towns?</p>
<p class="par">The Russians are essentially a brave and noble people;
it is impossible to live amongst them and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>not admire and like
them. They love their sovereign with a personal devotion almost beyond
bounds, and they can and have fought for their country to the death,
but they know their system of government is very faulty.</p>
<p class="par">Late events especially have led them to see how the
present system tends to much oppression and venality, and that though
the Emperor really labours earnestly and unweariedly for the welfare of
his subjects, yet it is impossible any one man can sufficiently
superintend and legislate for so vast an empire.</p>
<p class="par">On the gentle slope of a pretty grass hill, where a
flock of sheep were peacefully grazing, is the simple stone erected to
the memory of the noble 23rd Welsh Fusileers, and a few feet from it
are a number of long, narrow trenches, the edges roughly marked by
stones, the graves of their gallant enemies.</p>
<p class="par">Many hundred Russians lie here, but neither cross nor
monument records <i>their</i> names. In a few more years the stones
will be all dispersed, and nothing will then mark the spot where so
frightful an amount of human life was sacrificed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">We again descended the valley to visit the tomb of
Captain Horace Cust. It is owing to the kind care of our hostess that
it is still in existence. When the family returned to Burlinck after
the war, Madame B&mdash;&mdash; found the stone thrown down, defaced,
and half buried in the earth, but she had it repaired and by a curious
accident Captain Cust&rsquo;s brother arrived in Sevastopol and came to
see the little monument only the day after it had been replaced. But
for Madame B&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s kindness few of the graves would
have been respected, for the Tartars are very destructive, and carry
off everything that they think has any value.</p>
<p class="par">Count B&mdash;&mdash; has been a great sufferer from the
war. His property near the Alma was worth about twenty thousand roubles
a year. Now it barely yields enough to supply the family with more than
simple necessaries. Formerly they spent the winter in the old Russian
capital, Moscow, now they go for a few months to Simpheropol, and live
here as simple farmers during the rest of the year, and a farm-life in
the Crimea does not imply the comforts that are to be found on most
English homesteads. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"
name="pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Though our host has lost so much&mdash;for besides his
house several farms were burnt, the cattle seized, and the vineyards
and woods destroyed&mdash;there are very many others who have been
still more unfortunate. For instance, his aunt, Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash;,
before the war began was the owner of a fine property with a large
house in the valley of Tchernaia, but long ere the siege was over she
found herself absolutely ruined.</p>
<p class="par">It seems wonderful that the landing of large bodies of
foreign troops should have caused so little alarm amongst the
inhabitants of the Crimea, but far from fearing danger for themselves,
the prevailing feeling was apparently astonishment that any army should
be so rash as thus to court its own destruction. Sevastopol was
believed to be so safe that it is said some adventurous female spirits
wished to proceed there, to witness in person the discomfiture and
defeat of the allied forces.</p>
<p class="par">When the allies landed, Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash;, being in
bad health, was unwilling to leave home. Sevastopol was so near that
there seemed but little or no danger that a retreat into the town could
be cut off. The Heights of the Alma also were supposed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>present a formidable if not an insurmountable
obstacle to the advance of the enemy, so Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash; and her
household remained at Tchernaia.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One evening,&rdquo; said Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash;,
&ldquo;we were sitting round the card-table playing loto, but I was a
little uneasy that a messenger I had sent to one of my nephews in
Sevastopol had not yet returned. A sudden noise was heard in the hall;
and my niece was hurrying to the door of the saloon, when it was
hastily thrown open by the messenger, accompanied by several of the
servants, who with scared faces and in breathless accents announced
that a party of foreign cavalry had been seen to enter a wood only a
few versts from the house, and that if we meant to escape there was not
a moment to lose.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the hurry and alarm of such a departure it was
not possible to take away with us more than mere necessaries, and
though most of the valuables, such as silver and pictures, had happily
been sent to Simpheropol many weeks previously, still,&rdquo; said poor
Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash;, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;I left my dear home
full of every comfort and luxury. I dare not lament,&rdquo; said the
kind old lady, as a few tears ran slowly down her cheeks, &ldquo;over
my poor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>furniture and little treasures when I remember
the dreadful sorrows that came to us afterwards, but it gives a bitter
pang to an old woman like myself, on returning to a once dear and happy
home, to find only a heap of blackened ruins,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She did not mention what we knew, namely, that all the
remains of her little fortune had gone to help the sick and wounded,
for when she retreated into Sevastopol she joined the devoted band of
the Sisters of Mercy, and eventually became one of the
lady-superintendents of hospitals. In spite of feeble health, in spite
of the constant danger to which she was exposed, this good woman
remained steadily at her post until the troops withdrew to the north
side.</p>
<p class="par">We did not like to ask many questions, for, like all who
shared in those terrible duties, the scenes they then saw seem to have
been too dreadful to bear being dwelt on, and the kind creature could
not relate without tears some of the sad incidents that had come under
her notice. Some of her patients were poor little fellows, whose
manhood all deserted them under the pain of their wounds, and these she
held in her motherly arms till their cries <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>ceased, and death mercifully took them from
their sufferings.</p>
<p class="par">Like Androvna R&mdash;&mdash;, Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash;
said that all sense of personal danger became so soon merged in higher
anxieties, that even the narrow escapes of many of the nurses ceased to
excite much interest. The trial was to hear cries for the help that
could not be given&mdash;to see terrible sufferings without the
possibility of affording relief. In spite of heroic courage, nature
would occasionally give way at the sight of wounds and mutilations of
unusual horror, but still the devoted band of women never slackened
their efforts, and laboured unweariedly at their divine and holy
task.</p>
<p class="par">The Russian soldier seems to be as patient in the
hospital as he is obedient and brave on the battle-field. The poor
fellows, unless very young, bore their sufferings with great fortitude,
and Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash; said it was most touching to see their
unselfishness and consideration for others. From her account there was
an excellent staff of surgeons, though scarcely numerous enough for the
requirements of such vast numbers of wounded. There appears also to
have been a good supply of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>medicine, but there was a
considerable deficiency of linen and bandages. The main cause of the
great suffering arose from the very limited amount of
accommodation.</p>
<p class="par">The hospitals were frightfully crowded, and consequently
the air became so impure that the wounds could not heal, and gangrene
and disease carried off as many Russians as the guns of the enemy.</p>
<p class="par">Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash; was the unconscious heroine of a
little story that went the round of most English and French journals.
It was reported that Prince Menschikoff&rsquo;s carriage had fallen
into the hands of the allies, and many were the jokes that were made
respecting a certain pretty pink satin bonnet, and other articles
appertaining to a lady&rsquo;s toilet, that had been found packed
therein. Unfortunately for the lovers of romance, both carriage and
bonnet belonged to our friend Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash;, who, though both
charming and good-looking for her age, is no longer a young woman,
being between sixty and seventy. The carriage in question had been
packed to go to Simpheropol, but when the hurried flight became
necessary it was found too heavy for such a rapid journey, and it had
to be abandoned to its fate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash; wishes to sell her estate at
Tchernaia, but landed property in the neighbourhood of Sevastopol has
so deteriorated in value that she has not yet succeeded in finding a
purchaser, and it may be some years before she will be able to do so.
It is almost equally impossible to let it. One farm is now in
cultivation, and a few grass fields are let for grazing sheep, but the
greater portion of the land has been left untilled and useless.</p>
<p class="par">It was at first expected that the Government would have
paid five per cent. on all property destroyed, but the expenses of the
war have been so infinitely greater than was originally supposed, that
the unfortunate proprietors say now they shall think themselves well
off if they succeed in obtaining one per cent. of indemnification. It
will be many years before the country will be able to recover the
effects of so violent a blow.</p>
<p class="par">We left the Alma, with a storm muttering in the
distance, and every probability of wind, but soon after passing
Sevastopol the breeze dropped and it fell dead calm. Not a puff filled
the sails, which flapped idly against the masts; but somehow or other
we drifted on, and the coast scenery <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>was so fine that we
did not regret the slow progress.</p>
<p class="par">Magnificent cliffs, valleys wooded nearly to the
water&rsquo;s edge, and pretty villages made quite a panorama of
beautiful views, whose general aspect reminded us much of the
Undercliff of the Isle of Wight, only on a far grander scale.</p>
<p class="par">Aloupka, Prince Woronzoff&rsquo;s place, is most lovely.
The house is built of grey granite, and seemed to us exceedingly
picturesque, though architects and connoisseurs would probably shake
their heads dismally over it, as a specimen of bad taste.</p>
<p class="par">The architecture, it must be admitted, is certainly
&ldquo;<i>very mixed</i>,&rdquo; being partly Gothic, partly Moorish,
and altogether modern; but the numerous pinnacles and towers, and the
long fa&ccedil;ade of buildings rising above the magnificent woods,
have a remarkably good effect. A series of broad terraces descend from
the house half way down to the sea; beautiful gardens, full of rare
shrubs and flowers, lie on each side of the house, and the woods and
park stretch away for miles along the cliffs.</p>
<p class="par">General Malthoff has a very fine place, more in-land;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>and a few miles beyond Yalta is Orianda, the
Empress&rsquo;s villa.</p>
<p class="par">Yalta itself is a tiny village, lying close to the sea,
and surrounded by, almost buried in, a magnificent amphitheatre of
mountains. The village contains about fifty houses, all nestling round
a little wooded hill, on the top of which stands the church, its bright
green cupolas and gilded pinnacles looking resplendent in the brilliant
sunshine.</p>
<p class="par">The villas, however, are the glory of Yalta. On every
slope, peeping through openings in the dark green woods, are the pretty
white houses. Almost all are half covered with creepers, and standing
in gardens now gay with flowers, have an air of comfort and <i lang=
"de">Heimlichkeit</i>, or <i>homeishness</i> (if such a word can be
permitted), to which we have long been strangers.</p>
<p class="par">The lovely woods&mdash;the green grass&mdash;the fresh
mountain air make Yalta quite a little paradise. We had the additional
pleasure, also, of finding friends here&mdash;Prince and Princess
B&mdash;&mdash;, who came on board immediately, and whose affectionate
welcome, and cheery talk of old times and old friends, made this
distant place feel quite like home. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">We had also another visitor, an American, who, seeing
the English flag, came on board to borrow some money. He was one of the
unfavourable specimens of Yankeyism who do so much discredit to their
country, and whose principle is to ask for a gate when they want a bit
of wood. The modest request was for &pound;25, which Mr. Harvey
declined to lend, but I suppose his heart being touched by seeing a
foreigner so far from home, and in distress, he gave him enough to take
him to Sevastopol, with a note to an American there, who would help him
if necessary. Our friend then said, however, that he heard we were
going on to Circassia, and as it was very difficult to get there, he
thought he might as well take &ldquo;a spell&rdquo; with us, as he
could fix himself down in the yacht very well. As he spoke, the
sensible little craft made a sudden roll and a lurch, that caused such
an internal convulsion in our would-be companion that he threw himself
into the boat and departed, happily for us to return no more.</p>
<p class="par">The next day we went with the B&mdash;&mdash;s and a
large party to Orianda. Our conveyance was an immense
char-&agrave;-banc, that could hold quite a dozen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>people. There were scarcely any springs to speak
of, but luckily the roads were excellent.</p>
<p class="par">The drive from Yalta to Orianda is one of the most
beautiful I have ever seen. Sometimes the road wound up and down hills,
and then we could look over the steep banks of woods or vines upon the
intensely blue sea below. Sometimes it passed between great overhanging
rocks that almost met overhead; then, again, it would cross sunny bits
of rough common, or wind down narrow deep lanes where the damp coolness
was delicious, and where the high banks seemed hung with ferns, and
woodbines, and other plants that love the warm moist shade.</p>
<p class="par">We passed a charming house of Count Potocki&rsquo;s. The
broad verandah was quite festooned with passion flowers, roses, and the
bright lilac blossom of the Clematis Jackmanni. The gardens and grounds
were as well kept as any English home could be. The neat hedges, gravel
walks, and smooth lawns made us think we must be in England again.</p>
<p class="par">We left the carriage at the lodge gates and walked down
the beautiful road to Orianda, sometimes passing under trellises of
vines, where the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193"
name="pb193">193</a>]</span>purple grapes were hanging in delicious
profusion, then going through woods and avenues of fine trees.</p>
<p class="par">The rays of the setting sun were now streaming through
every opening, making the old Scotch firs look all aflame in the
glorious light.</p>
<p class="par">The villa is a large, white Grecian building, not
handsome enough for a palace nor pretty enough for a country house.
There are some fine rooms, rather grand and very gloomy. The
pleasantest sitting-room was a hall, painted and decorated like a
Pompeian court, with a fountain in the centre, surrounded by flowers
and ferns.</p>
<p class="par">The gardens and terraces make the delight of the place.
Vines, myrtles, and magnolia-trees are trained over arches, and under
their fragrant shade, the air cooled by innumerable fountains, how
pleasantly must the summer days pass! What an enchanting change from
hot, dusty St. Petersburg!</p>
<p class="par">The present Empress has not yet paid this pretty place a
visit, but the Grand-Duchess Constantine came for several months one
summer. Her Imperial Highness seems to have made herself universally
popular; her parties enlivened the whole <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>neighbourhood, and
she is spoken of by all classes with the heartiest affection.</p>
<p class="par">Within an hour after sunset the wind became bitterly
cold, and every cloak and shawl was called into requisition during the
drive home. This sudden change of temperature is the only drawback to
Yalta, and invalids who come here for health must carefully avoid
exposing themselves to the night-air. The dew also falls very heavily;
therefore here, as in Italy, the hour after sunset is a dangerous
period. Later in the night, for those who are strong, the fresh wind is
very invigorating.</p>
<p class="par">Yalta is so favourite a spot that people come even from
Petersburg to spend the summer here. It gives one some idea of the
enormous extent of Russia to know that it is a fortnight&rsquo;s
journey, travelling night and day, to get from Yalta to St.
Petersburg.</p>
<p class="par">Thanks to our kind friends, the B&mdash;&mdash;s, we
have seen all the prettiest villas in the neighbourhood. Count
Narisckine has a very lovely estate. There are also some beautiful
places now unhappily shut up and uninhabited, the owners having been
ruined by the war. Land and houses can now be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>bought very cheap, but unfortunately Yalta is
too far from England to make it available as a summer residence.</p>
<p class="par">Prince Woronzoff has a very fine property at Aloupka,
and a nearer approach made it even more beautiful than we had thought
it from the yacht. The house stands in a magnificent position on a
narrow ridge of table-land between the cliffs and the sea. Great dark
woods stretch around it for miles, and the rock scenery is quite
superb. Our Russian friends did not, however, share our enthusiasm, and
thought the more cultivated, smiling scenery round Yalta infinitely
more beautiful.</p>
<p class="par">On arriving at Aloupka we drove through a fine gateway
into a courtyard, on one side of which was the house, on the other were
the offices and stables. Immediately within the portico was seen the
hospitable &ldquo;Salve,&rdquo; set in large letters in the mosaic
pavement. A glass door opened into the hall, a moderate-sized room,
panelled with oak and hung round with family portraits. Amongst them
was a picture of the late Lady Pembroke. Princess Woronzoff&rsquo;s
boudoir and a few other small rooms were on one side of the entrance;
on the other was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196</a>]</span>the great dining-hall, a large and lofty
room with three recesses: two of these were occupied by fireplaces, the
other had a small fountain, an agreeable addition to a dining-room on a
hot day.</p>
<p class="par">Another glass door led to a very pretty room&mdash;half
saloon, half conservatory. Climbing plants were trained up the columns
and over the frames of the looking-glasses. Masses of flowers were
arranged in groups upon the marble floor, while thick Persian carpets
and every sort of comfortable lounge and easy chair made the apartment
the very perfection of a summer sitting-room.</p>
<p class="par">Russians have quite a talent for decorating their rooms
with flowers and shrubs, and should nothing better be forthcoming,
branches of trees make a background for the little cluster of plants
that are placed in every corner. Dwarf palms or tree-ferns have a
charming effect when crowning a group of flowering shrubs.</p>
<p class="par">On the storey below were the salons and library. The
latter was a large and comfortable room, well filled with books, the
tables being covered with the newest French and English
publications.</p>
<p class="par">Prince and Princess Woronzoff were away, so we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>soon finished our inspection of the house.
Though thoroughly comfortable, it is much smaller in reality than its
appearance from the sea would lead one to expect. Seen from a distance
the long, imposing fa&ccedil;ade makes it look quite like a palace.</p>
<p class="par">The grounds, however, gained in beauty from a nearer
view. Great flights of steps lead to broad terraces, on which are the
most delicious gardens and lawns that imagination can picture. Every
flower to be found in England and Italy grows here in perfection,
revelling in an admirable climate and in an admirable soil.</p>
<p class="par">In front of the house was a stone colonnade, up every
pillar of which were trained climbing plants of unusual beauty. One in
particular was especially lovely, a species of <i>Mandevillia
superba</i>. There must have been many hundreds of the snowy white
fragrant flowers, shining like stars from the mass of glossy dark
foliage.</p>
<p class="par">In the centre of the colonnade was a portico as high as
the house itself, having a roof fretted and gilt after the fashion of
the Moorish courts in the Alhambra. Light balconies, supported by
clusters of columns, projected on either side, and comfortable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>sofas were arranged amongst the little wood of
orange and citron trees below.</p>
<p class="par">It was a day and a scene when life alone seemed a
delicious blessing. The soft breeze barely whispered amongst the
leaves, a few doves were tenderly cooing in the garden below, the very
fountains seemed unwilling to disturb the magic quiet, and their waters
fell soothingly into the marble basins, as if they were also hushing
nature to rest. Every now and then the sweet south wind sighed gently
over the wide expanse of sea, and then came upon the ear the trickle,
trickle of the little waves, as they rippled back amongst the pebbles
of the beach, and as the wind softly touched the trees overhead, down
came a fragrant rain of the snowy leaves of the orange-flowers, making
the ground white with the lovely blossoms.</p>
<p class="par">Talking of old times and old scenes, hours passed like
minutes in this enchanting and enchanted spot, and we had forgotten how
long we had been enjoying a feeling of divine repose that one longed
might last for ever, when the sun sank below the horizon. For a few
minutes there was a great blaze and glory of light, and then a grey
damp gloom stole over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>landscape that warned us to be
gone. Perhaps, even then, we should have lingered longer than was
warranted by strict prudence, but we were all engaged to have supper
with the T&mdash;&mdash;s, and knew the sportsmen, who had gone out
quail shooting, would have returned with clamorous appetites. The
rattling wheels of our char-&agrave;-banc were no sooner heard in the
village than out flew all the hungry party to know what had detained
us; but the roasted quails were so good, and so were the little
newly-baked sponge-cakes, that every one rejoiced in being hungry, and
a merry evening finished our pleasant day. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Having seen all that was to be seen in the
immediate neighbourhood of Yalta, it was unanimously agreed that the
yacht should be put in requisition, and that an expedition should be
made to Oursouf, a place on the coast, lately bought by Prince
B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p class="par">The day was fine, and the sea apparently smooth, but
there was a little ground-swell that made us somewhat anxious about the
happiness of our non-seafaring friends. Prince B&mdash;&mdash; was an
old sailor, but his wife such a bad one that she never ventured on
board a vessel under way. We were also very doubtful as to the sailing
powers of Prince T&mdash;&mdash; and his sister. Count and Countess
N&mdash;&mdash; had sailed with us before, and we knew they were proof,
but we much feared the S&mdash;&mdash;s and G&mdash;&mdash;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>were doomed to suffer. However, with admirable
courage, all came on board at the time appointed, and we set sail.</p>
<p class="par">While the wind lasted all went well, but unhappily about
mid-day the breeze dropped, and then, one after another, the poor
ladies fell victims to the levelling malady of sea-sickness, and the
cabins presented sad spectacles of suffering pleasure-seekers.</p>
<p class="par">Most fortunately Prince T&mdash;&mdash; was not ill. Had
he been so, we dared not picture to ourselves what would have been his
mental as well as his physical sufferings, for he had come on board in
a new and superb Tartar costume! We were speechless with amazement as
the resplendent vision appeared on deck. Even our captain and Charlie
could scarcely maintain a dignified silence, but Prince B&mdash;&mdash;
could not contain his feelings. &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pourquoi le
diable, T&mdash;&mdash;, &ecirc;tes-vous venu en costume de
bal?</span>&rdquo; burst involuntarily from his lips. Happily our guest
was ridicule-proof, for his toilette was the pride and happiness of his
life, and he frequently astonished the quiet inhabitants of Yalta by
appearing in four fresh suits a day. Only yesterday he had paid us a
visit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>in a complete costume of plaid. Coat, waistcoat,
trousers, linen, cap, even the pocket handkerchief, displayed the same
somewhat remarkable checked pattern. The unwonted and gorgeous toilette
that appeared to-day was, however, very little adapted for a nautical
expedition. Crimson satin trousers, a similar jacket, magnificently
embroidered in gold, and large loose sleeves made of fine cambric,
however beautiful in themselves, certainly seemed out of place on the
Black Sea, especially as the day was neither hot nor sunny. Our poor
friend&rsquo;s bare arms soon looked pinched and blue with cold, but we
dared not suggest either cloak or shawl for fear of injuring the
well-starched beauty of the transparent sleeves.</p>
<p class="par">However, at last the sun came out from behind the
clouds, the air became warm, so did the poor arms, the breeze revived,
the suffering ladies got better and appeared on deck, and in due time
we arrived at Oursouf. It was a beautiful spot, quite close to the sea,
and as wild as it was beautiful.</p>
<p class="par">On the slope of a neighbouring hill is Massandra,
another property belonging to the Woronzoff family. On another hill,
called Anaka, is a model nursery-garden, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>established by Count
Woronzoff when he was Governor of South Russia, and still kept up by
Government. Every description of tree, shrub, and flower that can be
grown in the climate is to be found in this nursery. Any one wishing to
make vineyards, plantations, or gardens can buy the plants, with the
advantage of learning the sort of tree, shrub, &amp;c., which may be
best adapted to the soil for which they are required.</p>
<p class="par">All this part of what may be called the Undercliff of
the Crimea seems peculiarly adapted for the culture of the vine.
Sheltered by a range of mountains, as well as by almost perpendicular
cliffs, from the keen north wind, the long slopes of rich soil seem to
invite the formation of vineyards. The grapes that are now produced are
excellent, and many sorts of wine have already been made.</p>
<p class="par">Several of the Rhine wines have been so closely
imitated&mdash;some even say excelled&mdash;that sanguine persons
predict that in time the Crimean wines will rank higher than the
Rhenish. Be that as it may, it seems a pity that the Russian growers
should be content in many instances to give German names to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>their produce, instead of creating their own
class of wines.</p>
<p class="par">A sort of liqueur, something like Constantia, is highly
prized by connoisseurs, but at present this is only produced in the
private vineyards of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e2034" title=
"Source: Barintinsky">Bariatinsky</span> and Woronzoff families, and at
Orianda, and cannot be purchased.</p>
<p class="par">Prince Woronzoff, who appears to have been a wise and
enlightened governor, had a favourite scheme for bringing large
districts into cultivation as vineyards. Unhappily, the war took place
ere he could put his project in execution, and the country is now so
impoverished and thrown back that it will be years before it can
recover from the shock.</p>
<p class="par">Oursouf is a little Tartar town, built on the slope of a
steep hill, and close to an enormous rock, on the top of which are some
ruins, said to have been once a castle.</p>
<p class="par">A few miles inland rises the grand mountain of the
Acondagh, so called from its outline being supposed to resemble a
crouching bear. &ldquo;Acon&rdquo; means bear; &ldquo;dagh&rdquo;
signifies mountain. Clouds were flitting over the summits of the range,
so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>the likeness, if it existed, was invisible to
our eyes.</p>
<p class="par">Prince B&mdash;&mdash; has bought a small property a few
versts from the village, and having lived much abroad, he intends
building a perfect Italian villa, so as to introduce a mode of
architecture which he believes will be remarkably well adapted both to
the country and climate. At present the foundations only have been dug,
but should our good fortune bring us here again in a few years, we hope
to find our kind friend established in his retired home.</p>
<p class="par">To those who do not object to pitch their tents away
from the haunts of companionable man, this little estate offers every
charm that can well be desired. The scenery is as beautiful as it is
magnificent.</p>
<p class="par">A lovely little wooded glen runs up from the sea, far
away into the mountains, that gradually become steeper and steeper,
until the stately Tchatar-Dagh appears in the distance, its rugged
sides partly covered with forest, and its lofty peaks crowned with
eternal snow.</p>
<p class="par">A rapid stream winds its way through the valley,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>sometimes dashing down in rapid cascades, then
lingering in dark and shady pools, whose banks seem the chosen home of
every sort of beautiful fern. The <i>Osmunda regalis</i> grows to a
size almost unknown in England, and tufts of many kinds of the delicate
maiden-hair nestle between the stones wherever the spray of the
waterfalls can reach their feathery branches. In the spring the lilies
of the valley must carpet the ground. In some sheltered spots we found
several varieties of large white lilies, and the autumnal cyclamen
revels in the rich sandy soil.</p>
<p class="par">Wild vines had climbed up many of the trees. The purple
bunches looked very beautiful amongst the foliage, but the wild vine is
dangerous in its close affection, and almost always destroys the poor
tree that it honours with its notice.</p>
<p class="par">On returning to the beach, we found the boat surrounded
by a crowd of Tartars, who were looking at the sailors with mingled
admiration and awe.</p>
<p class="par">The wind was fair for the little home-voyage, but though
the sea was not really rough, still there was sufficient movement to
make some of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>our poor friends very miserable, and it was a
relief to all parties when they were once more safely landed at Yalta.
Those who were not ill remained on board for supper, whist, and music;
and to our surprise, amongst these good sailors was the wearer of the
Tartar costume.</p>
<p class="par">It blew fresh all night, and a bank of heavy, dark
clouds to windward warned us that better shelter must be sought than
can be found at Yalta. Unfortunately there is no roadstead here, and
the anchorage is by no means secure.</p>
<p class="par">Our captain has been very restless and uneasy for the
last two days, and can find no charms in a place where half-a-dozen
anchors, as he says, would not hold the yacht should it come on to
blow. So to-night we are to say good-bye to all our kind friends, to
the green fields and to the pretty villas at Yalta.</p>
<p class="par">Pleasant, cheerful little place, in all probability we
shall never see you again, but amongst all the sunny memories our
rovings have given us, few will be more sunny, more smiling than the
remembrance of our days with you.</p>
<p class="par">We spent the last day on shore with our friends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>happily, though somewhat sadly, and when we
parted in the evening bore away with us not only the remembrance of
many affectionate words, but a little souvenir from each of the kind
hearts who had given such a sincere welcome to their English
friends.</p>
<p class="par">We left Yalta on the night of the 13th of September,
with a fresh, favourable breeze. About seven o&rsquo;clock on the
morning of the 16th, the worthy Domenico came knocking at all the cabin
doors. &ldquo;La terra, Eccellenza; si vede alfine la terra.&rdquo; The
good news brought us speedily on deck.</p>
<p class="par">A lovely day and a smooth sea welcomed us to Circassia.
How often we had talked about this enchanting, but far distant
country&mdash;how often we had longed to see it, never imagining that
such a wild dream could ever be realised; and now, before us, bright in
the light of a fresh, dewy morning, lay our land of promise&mdash;the
true &ldquo;land of the citron and myrtle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There are some things so beautiful that one shrinks from
describing them. Words cannot paint the loveliness that is seen by the
eye. To say that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>we saw before us a country that possessed,
with the tender charm of English woodland scenery, the rich glow of the
Italian landscape, and the grand majesty of Alpine ranges, gives but a
feeble idea of the delicious beauty of the land we were gazing on. The
light, the colouring, the exquisite effect of the soft mists as they
slowly arose from the valleys, can be better imagined than described,
but as we looked, we thought, Here is a land where Nature has in truth
perfected her handiwork!</p>
<p class="par">The yacht was moving gently on, there was barely a
ripple on the water, and, seemingly, we were within a stone&rsquo;s
throw of the shore. A little sandy beach ran along the edge of the sea,
then rose banks all mossy and ferny, with undulating grass-fields and
conical hills, with great clumps of oak and beech trees scattered
about. Then came a region of dark fir-woods, mingled with the tender
green of the weeping birches. Farther away still were steep hills and
rugged mountains, their sides all covered with vast forests, stretching
away far as the eye could reach, whilst above their dark shaggy masses
rose the majestic peaks of a distant range, glistening white in their
dazzling covering of eternal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>snow. Cattle and sheep were
wandering over the rich pastures, but peaceful as the country appeared,
peace is, in reality, the blessing most unknown to it. War is
constantly raging, and the smiling plain and pretty thickets before us
have been the scene of many a fierce struggle.</p>
<p class="par">We longed to land. The boat was being lowered for the
purpose, when luckily for us, as we afterwards discovered, a breeze
sprang up, and we continued our course towards Soukoum-Kal&eacute;. Had
we gone on shore, in all probability we should have been taken
prisoners by the hostile Circassians (who hold this part of the
country), carried up into the mountains, and compelled to pay a
considerable sum before our involuntary sojourn amongst them had
ended.</p>
<p class="par">A species of guerilla warfare is incessantly going on
between the inhabitants in these remote parts and the Russians. The
former consider all Europeans as enemies, and though the Russians are
nominally masters of the country, the Circassians still possess amongst
the mountains some strongholds that are almost impregnable.</p>
<p class="par">Whenever they have a chance, they make captures,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>on account of the ransoms they usually obtain.
Should the prisoner be of any importance, he generally prefers paying a
moderate sum, rather than endure months of miserable imprisonment. As
to the common soldiers, they are usually shot, their value being but
small.</p>
<p class="par">Had we been made prisoners, it would, of course, have
been possible to appeal both to the English and Russian Governments;
but the journeys to and from Constantinople and St. Petersburg are very
long, and as it would require some weeks to procure the necessary
money, we should have had to lead a wretched existence amongst the
mountains, making more experiences about wild Circassian life than
would probably have pleased us.</p>
<p class="par">There is an English consul at Soukoum, established since
the Crimean war, but it is almost an honorary appointment, as Soukoum
has no trade; and though Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; has deservedly the
greatest influence amongst the Russians, he is powerless as regards the
insurgent Circassians, and even had the Russian general sent troops to
our assistance, what can soldiers do against wandering bands, who have
no homes, nothing to lose, and whose simple <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>wants are supplied by the natural products of
the country?</p>
<p class="par">Near the sea-shore is a very curious old church, called
Pitsunda, standing quite alone miles away from any fort, or even traces
of village. Tradition says it was built during the reign of
Constantine, but nothing certain is known as to its origin. It was,
however, repaired towards the latter end of the thirteenth century, and
just before the last war with Turkey commenced, the Russians had made
preparations for restoring it completely. Fine stone and marble had
been brought from a considerable distance for the purpose, and we could
see some partially-worked blocks still lying around. A magnificent
cross in white marble, that had retained many traces of the rich
sculpture of the fifteenth century, fell a victim to the fanaticism of
the Turks. They shattered it into a thousand pieces, besides defacing
the interior of the building as much as possible.</p>
<p class="par">Even the Circassians (who are supposed to have no
religion) had always respected this church, and it is really grievous
that so fine a relic of antiquity should be falling into ruins.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As the day drew to its close the little breeze dropped,
and the sea rested so calmly in its deep tranquillity, that not a
ripple disturbed its mirror-like surface. The very forests appeared to
be slumbering in the sun. A pile of light fleecy clouds that had been
slowly flitting about all day changed to a soft crimson, and floated on
a sky that shaded from intense blue to the most brilliant rose-colour.
Then a shower of gold seemed to fall, and the clouds changed into a
long veil of pink vapour, that hung lightly, like a scarf, over the
snowy peaks of the distant mountains.</p>
<p class="par">As we watched this lovely shade, the sun sank below the
horizon, a blaze of golden light shot up, the sea became deep purple,
the snow-mountains gradually lost their rosy glow, and an unearthly
pallor&mdash;beautiful, yet awfully like death&mdash;stole gently over
the long line of peaks, growing paler and paler, until at length
darkness hid the shore from our sight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">SOUKOUM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The next morning it was discovered, to the
vexation of all on board, that we had overshot our mark. A headland had
been mistaken, and the yacht was some miles beyond Soukoum-Kal&eacute;.
We had to work our way back again therefore, and it was mid-day before
the anchor was dropped in the roadstead opposite the little town.</p>
<p class="par">Navigation off this coast is very difficult. There are
but few charts, and even these few are not correct. Indeed it is hinted
that there is no desire that the difficulties should be diminished.</p>
<p class="par">The country around Soukoum is quite as beautiful as any
we have yet seen; but the town itself, though its low, white houses
scattered along the shore and up the sides of the wooded hills are
picturesque <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>enough, seems a small, insignificant place,
little more than a Russian fort.</p>
<p class="par">A Russian transport and three small ships of war were
anchored near us, the decks and yards thronged with people anxious to
see such an unusual, such a wonderful sight as an English yacht. The
<i>Claymore</i> has the honour of being the first vessel to fly the
Royal Yacht Squadron flag at Soukoum-Kal&eacute;.</p>
<p class="par">On shore the same excitement prevailed. The beach was
crowded with people, who watched our movements with the greatest
interest and curiosity, evidently brought to a culminating point when
they saw ladies and children on board. The English consul, Mr.
D&mdash;&mdash;, soon arrived, kindly anxious to give every assistance.
By-and-by the governor and admiral, attended by their aides-de-camp,
also came on board; and after a time we went on shore with them.</p>
<p class="par">The beach where we landed was crowded with Russians and
Circassians, many of the latter the wildest-looking creatures
imaginable. They were mostly however fine, tall men, with remarkably
erect and graceful figures, intelligent faces, and large, dark, fiery
eyes. Their dignified bearing was in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>marked contrast to
the depressed appearance and careworn countenances of the majority of
the Russians.</p>
<p class="par">In poverty and in rags a Circassian retains his
independent, self-relying manner, and looks (what he generally is) a
bold mountaineer, who, notwithstanding his nominal submission to a
foreign power, preserves his liberty, and, with gun and sword, can
defend his own against the world. This same gun and sword, it is
asserted, are not unfrequently turned to other and less legitimate
uses, for their owner does not scruple to avail himself of any
favourable opportunity of enriching his purse by their aid.</p>
<p class="par">The Circassian dress is very picturesque. Large, loose
trousers are tucked into high boots, with a dark coat made full in the
skirts, whilst across the chest is a row of long, narrow pouches, in
which the ammunition is carried. The high cap is made of coarse cloth,
the lower part covered with sheepskin. The horsemen from the mountains
wear, instead of this cap, a long pointed hood, called a
&ldquo;papack,&rdquo; made of canvas and shaped like a monk&rsquo;s
cowl, with two long ends that hang over the shoulders. Each
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>man carries a carbine, rolled in sheepskin,
slung at his back, and has pistols (often handsomely mounted in silver)
stuck into his girdle.</p>
<p class="par">Circassians, as a rule, have singularly small hands and
feet, and the beauty of the latter is much enhanced by the boots they
wear. These boots are made without soles, and are of scarlet or crimson
leather so well prepared, and so fine in texture, that they at once
take the shape of the foot, and fit like gloves.</p>
<p class="par">The houses in Soukoum are low, being seldom more than
one storey high; but they are very pretty, being generally surrounded
by broad verandahs that are covered with creepers, and having gardens
full of flowering trees and shrubs.</p>
<p class="par">About the middle of the town, or village, is a large
rough square, the exercising-ground of the troops; and beyond this
again, bordered by a double row of trees, is a sort of road called by
the dignified name of the Boulevard. All the best houses are here,
including those of the governor and admiral. There may have been eight
or ten more of nearly equal size. The others were very small,
containing but two, or perhaps three rooms. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The road was exceedingly pretty, with its fine trees;
and a raised pathway under their shade made a very pleasant walk. It
led to a rough common, where several large flocks of geese were
disporting themselves in the little clear pools of water.</p>
<p class="par">For some reason or other,&mdash;why we never clearly
understood,&mdash;Russians have an idea that the goose is the pet bird
of all English homesteads, and that a flock of geese has a romantic
charm to the English eye far beyond that which any other bird can
possess. These geese were, therefore, pointed out to us by our
companions as likely to awake many tender reminiscences of home. But it
is a sad and, perhaps also, a humiliating confession to make, that
instead of contemplating these excellent birds with feelings of
tenderness, as suggestive of home nooks and corners in dear Old
England, we gazed upon them with sentiments of the lowest and most
earthly domestic interest. A tolerably long course of skinny chickens
and preserved meats had so deteriorated our higher tastes and
sensibilities, and had so sharpened our appetites, that the first
thought was that now we would have roast goose for dinner, and that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>the excellent Domenico could replenish the empty
poultry-coops.</p>
<p class="par">But in truth the scene was very pretty, and wonderfully
like England. The heathy common, with its patches of gorse and tufts of
&ldquo;bracken,&rdquo; the white cottages peeping out amidst the trees,
the groups of birch and alder bushes that skirted the little pools, the
clumps of rugged old Scotch firs, made us feel for a moment that we
must have been seated on Prince Hussein&rsquo;s magic carpet, and in
the twinkling of an eye had been transported to a sunny glade in the
Hampshire New Forest. But ere the thought found words, a herd of
buffaloes crossing the path, and then a group of wild figures armed to
the teeth, their dark eyes glittering fiercely from beneath their white
hoods as they dashed rapidly by, speedily dispelled the illusion, and
showed how far we were from the peaceful highways and byways of
home.</p>
<p class="par">In a beautiful nook on the slope of a hill is a charming
little house, a perfect bower of roses. This is the English consulate,
and as far as the desires of the eye can be gratified, man could not
wish for anything more lovely; but Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, as well as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>most people here, has been suffering acutely
from fever.</p>
<p class="par">The very beauty we admire, namely, the wondrous
luxuriance of the vegetation, is one of the great evils of the country,
or rather becomes so, from the carelessness and indolence of man. Were
the land properly cultivated, Abasia (as this part of Circassia is
called) would be a paradise. The soil is so fertile, and the climate so
temperate, that nearly every description of grain, fruit, and vegetable
might be grown with very little trouble.</p>
<p class="par">It seems almost incredible that in a country so rich and
productive that a few hours&rsquo; industry would insure an abundant
harvest, <i>every</i> fruit and vegetable, including even potatoes,
should be imported from Trebisonde.</p>
<p class="par">Unhappily the Circassians are too proud and too indolent
to work, and until better guarantees can be given for the preservation
of life and property, colonists cannot of course be expected to
settle.</p>
<p class="par">At present the Russian soldiers are the only
agricultural labourers, and as their military duties are severe, the
result is that only sufficient ground is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>cultivated to supply
the horses with hay and forage.</p>
<p class="par">Military service in the Caucasus has been for many years
unpopular amongst the Russian regiments. The duty is arduous, and the
great distance from the capital causes it to be looked upon, especially
by the officers, as a banishment little inferior to that of being sent
to serve in Siberia. Indeed, some of those we knew were of opinion the
northern was the less objectionable station of the two, for the
constant attacks of fever, from which it seems almost impossible to
escape, cause, not only exhaustion of body, but a mental depression
that is very trying to the sufferers.</p>
<p class="par">This accounted for the haggard and cadaverous appearance
of so large a proportion of the soldiery. We hear also that the ratio
of mortality is very large. Fever prevails all the summer, and is more
or less dangerous according to the quantity of rain that falls, but
during the months of July and August it usually rages with frightful
severity. During a rainy season the mortality is quite terrible.</p>
<p class="par">Last year out of five thousand soldiers three thousand
were suffering from fever, while there was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>not
one case amongst the seamen on board the Russian men-of-war lying at
anchor opposite the town.</p>
<p class="par">Vessels, during the summer months, remain as far away in
the roadstead as possible, the air from the town being so fraught with
disease.</p>
<p class="par">During the course of our walk we ascended a little
detached hill called the Upper Fort, and felt immediately the relief of
being able to breathe the fresh invigorating mountain breeze, after the
relaxing warmth and dampness of the air in the town below. Happily the
hospitals are here, for it is the only really healthy spot in Soukoum.
Were the sick obliged to remain in the valley, the deaths would
probably be doubled.</p>
<p class="par">Close to the fort is a small house where Omar Pasha
lived with some of his wives when the Turkish army occupied Abasia. It
is quite a tiny place, only containing four rooms, but notwithstanding
the confined space, the poor women, it is said, were never allowed to
go out. Tradition, however, does not say whether their beauty was so
dazzling that it was not safe to risk their being seen by the profane
eyes of unbelieving Giaours. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The views on all sides were most lovely, but the very
beauty had an air of desolate grandeur that produced a feeling of
depression. A perfect network of steep narrow valleys extended beyond
the region of wooded hills immediately before us. Great banks of forest
clothed their steep sides, stretching far away, dark and silent, until
their gloomy outlines were lost in the shadowy recesses of the
mountains. Here and there the silver line of a distant water-fall
caught the rays of the setting sun, and glittered for a few minutes
amidst the sombre masses of the woods; but, though so near the town, no
sound broke the stillness&mdash;no song of birds, no voice of man, no
cheerful token of the neighbourhood of cattle or home life disturbed
the silence of evening.</p>
<p class="par">We had followed a sort of track that skirted the nearest
valley. Wild flowers grew around in such beauty and profusion that it
was impossible not to gather handfuls as we passed. Honeysuckle and
eglantine hung in garlands from every bush; wild hops and vines
festooned the trees. In every rocky hollow were tufts of the pretty
caper-plant, with its lovely blossoms of mauve and white, while the
ground <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>seemed covered with bright geraniums,
many-tinted asters, late cyclamen, and the dwarf myrtle. And then the
wondrous beauty of the mossy wood we entered next, where the sunbeams
quivered over a perfect carpet of lovely grasses, lichens, and graceful
ferns. Charming though it was, we dared not prolong our stroll, for the
sun was sinking low, and not only is the evening air supposed to be
laden with fever, but our companions assured us that it would be
scarcely prudent to be beyond the fort when night had come. We
quickened our steps, but notwithstanding all our haste, it was nearly
dusk before we arrived at the town.</p>
<p class="par">It was startling to see, from time to time, a wild
horseman gallop by, looking all the more wild and eerie from the dim
uncertain light. Mounted on little wiry horses, they rode at headlong
speed towards the gloomy passes in the mountains, and long after they
were out of sight we could hear their swords clattering against their
large stirrups as they dashed rapidly over the rough ground.</p>
<p class="par">It is difficult to find adequate words in which to
express our sense of the great kindness of all our friends in Soukoum.
Not only have horses and an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>escort of Cossacks been placed at
our disposal during the whole of our stay, but every little wish has
been anticipated. As to our poultry coops, they have been filled to
overflowing with the best poultry the place can produce, and the milk
of the only available cow in the town has been devoted to our use. The
wish of seeing the various ferns and wild flowers of the country
speedily brought baskets of the most lovely specimens on board the
yacht. Music and sketches were also among the generous gifts. In short,
so great has been the kindness, that words fail with which to describe
it.</p>
<p class="par">Should, however, these few pages be ever seen by any of
the kind and accomplished friends who made Circassia even a more
enchanting land to us than we had pictured it in our dreams, they will
see that they are remembered with feelings of the truest gratitude and
admiration by their English guests.</p>
<p class="par">Few people are more accomplished than the Russians; and
in this remote corner of the world we have had musical evenings that
would have obtained approval from the most fastidious connoisseur.</p>
<p class="par">Beethoven and Chopin probably little thought
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>their delicious melodies would beguile many a
weary hour in countries beyond the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="par">The Governor arranged, soon after our arrival, to take
us a long ride towards the mountains, and on landing at the appointed
hour we found General B&mdash;&mdash; awaiting us with quite a troop of
men and horses drawn up on the beach.</p>
<p class="par">Besides the horses provided for us, others had been
prepared for Domenico and Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s servant, who,
under the guidance and protection of four soldiers, were to go on a
foraging expedition to a neighbouring village. Domenico, as we have
said, has many excellent qualities, but courage is not perhaps his most
brilliant virtue. At the last moment his small amount of valour failed
him. He entreated with such a rueful countenance to be allowed to go
with our stronger party&mdash;with earnest gesticulations and in a
torrent of Neapolitan he drew so moving a picture of what <i>our</i>
feelings would be if he were brought back dead instead of the
chickens&mdash;that our hearts were moved, and it was settled that he
and the other servant should accompany us, and take the chance of what
good luck might send in the shape of geese and turkeys. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The escort consisted of six Cossacks and a corporal. All
were well armed with muskets, pistols, &amp;c., but the horses they
rode were so thin, and seemed so out of condition, that we wondered at
first how the poor things could stand.</p>
<p class="par">We had not long started, however, before we perceived
that they <i>went</i> wonderfully well, and actually looked better at
the end of the ride than they did at the beginning.</p>
<p class="par">The horses provided for us were beautiful little Persian
Arabs, lively yet gentle, perfectly free from vice, and having a light
springy action most delightful to their riders. General B&mdash;&mdash;
had bought them in Persia, and had paid a large price for them even
there.</p>
<p class="par">The guide, a young Circassian, grandly arrayed in a
brilliant yellow coat and scarlet boots, and fully armed with
matchlock, pistols, and sabre, rode at the head of the troop.</p>
<p class="par">Circassian saddles look exceedingly clumsy and
uncomfortable. They are very peaked and very high, but the Circassians
are first-rate horsemen; they use short stirrups, have the regular
English hunting-seat, holding on by the knees, and rise in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>their trot in a very unmilitary but thoroughly
jockey-like fashion.</p>
<p class="par">We had our own saddles, and they evidently excited much
wonder amongst the little crowd that had collected. We were watched
with absorbed interest, as the various preparations of tightening
girths, &amp;c., were made, but when at last Mr. Harvey mounted my
sister and myself in the English fashion, the feelings of the
spectators found vent in a little cry of astonishment.</p>
<p class="par">We were deeply impressed with the warlike fashion of our
departure. The guide and two Cossacks rode in front, then came General
B&mdash;&mdash;, some Russian officers, and ourselves, followed by the
rest of the soldiers, and a formidable jingling and clattering there
was as the little troop swept through the town.</p>
<p class="par">We crossed the common, and entered a very pretty wood of
beech and oak trees. Occasional openings showed the sea on one side,
and on the other low, steep, wooded hills, with huge boulders of
granite rearing their grey sides above the trees.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the masses of rock were so smooth and round that
they looked like gigantic marbles, as if <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>the Titans had been
disporting themselves amidst the lofty summits of El-Barouz, and had
rolled some of their playthings into the valleys beneath.</p>
<p class="par">From time to time we passed long narrow glens that gave
vistas of apparently endless chains of hill and mountain; the nearest
looking dark purple in the strong light, others beyond growing
gradually paler and less distinct, until they became at last blended
with the blue distance, a faint glimmer of snow alone indicating the
most distant peaks.</p>
<p class="par">As the day wore on a soft breeze arose, that just
rustled the leaves and made the air fresh and cool, doubly refreshing
after the great heat of the morning. The earth gave forth the sweet
scent that so often comes after heavy dew. The grassy way was good; our
horses were excellent. It was delightful to be once more on
horseback&mdash;a pleasure we had not had for months; so, giving the
rein to our willing steeds, on we went at a pace that evidently
astonished the Cossacks, and delighted kind General B&mdash;&mdash; and
our Circassian. As for the latter he was fairly enchanted; he waved his
arms above his head, rose in his stirrups, and bending <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>over
his horse&rsquo;s neck, dashed forward at full speed.</p>
<p class="par">This rapid pace, however, could not be kept up after
leaving the grassy plain, for we then entered the hill country, where
forest and thick underwood made the way more difficult, and where
treacherous bogs had to be skirted and sometimes traversed.</p>
<p class="par">These bogs during the winter and spring are almost
impassable. During the summer months they can be crossed in certain
directions. In consequence of the late drought, they are just now
unusually firm, but nevertheless we had to jump over several little
watercourses and dangerously green places.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes, too, the ground shook under the horses&rsquo;
feet as if it meant to swallow us up, but our sagacious animals made
their way with the utmost precaution, and evidently thoroughly
understood their business.</p>
<p class="par">Very dreary-looking places were these bogs, as they lay
brown and gloomy under the shadow of the forest, their treacherous
surface only broken here and there by bushes of stunted birch-trees. We
could well understand how goblin-like must <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>seem
the myriad lights of the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps, as they dance in
unearthly fashion over such dark and dangerous morasses.</p>
<p class="par">Again we plunged into the thick forest, and another
hour&rsquo;s riding brought us to the entrance of a narrow defile, the
gateway, as it were, to the mountain regions.</p>
<p class="par">The way became rough and difficult, being merely the bed
of a mountain torrent, and the number of loose and slippery stones made
it very troublesome for the horses to find secure footing. The scenery
grew wild and stern; great masses of rock hung over the pass, in many
places almost meeting overhead.</p>
<p class="par">Little streams came rushing down from the heights,
tumbling headlong over the precipice, when they arrived at the steep
walls of rocks that hemmed us in on every side.</p>
<p class="par">The defile, or rather ravine, for it was evidently but a
passage the stream had worn for itself in the course of countless ages
of time, was so deep and narrow that it made one quite giddy to look
up.</p>
<p class="par">Vertigo ordinarily affects the head when looking
<i>down</i>; we had never known the sensation before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>when
looking <i>up</i> at a great height; but the rapid passage of the
clouds across the narrow, crooked opening above, when looked at for a
few minutes, made everything seem to whirl round.</p>
<p class="par">Wherever a few broken stones had allowed a little earth
to collect, masses of rhododendrons and groups of birch had taken root.
Their graceful forms and bright green leaves made cheerful spots of
life and beauty amidst the rugged severity of the gloomy scene.</p>
<p class="par">As we advanced further into the pass, not a sound was
heard but the rush of the mountain torrents, and the harsh cry of an
eagle as he wheeled slowly over our heads.</p>
<p class="par">We all became silent. It was almost disagreeable to hear
the champing of the horses, and the occasional rattle of the
accoutrements, as we moved slowly but steadily on, our companions
keeping a wary look-out on all sides, though it was believed that the
country was at present unusually quiet.</p>
<p class="par">Still a very few more miles must be our limit. It would
not be prudent to advance much farther into the wild region before
us.</p>
<p class="par">It must be admitted that on first starting we had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>thought our warlike escort was more for honour
than for real use, but even before we had entered this savage defile it
was evident how well it was for us that we were surrounded by so many
brave protectors. &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure,&rdquo; and a
strong party often prevents an attack being made.</p>
<p class="par">Once amidst the gloomy defiles and dark recesses of
these wild mountains defenceless travellers would have no chance
against a predatory band; they would be as sheep walking into a
lion&rsquo;s den.</p>
<p class="par">From time to time we had met parties of mountaineers,
some on horseback, some on foot, but all completely and heavily
armed.</p>
<p class="par">Although in actual distance so few versts from the town,
the mountains surround it so closely&mdash;the country is so desolate,
and also intersected even in the lowlands by ravines and
morasses&mdash;that, had we been alone, resistance to these armed bands
would have been hopeless.</p>
<p class="par">Before assistance could have arrived we should, in all
probability, have been conveyed away to some distant fortress, there to
remain until the required ransom had been paid. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The astonishment of the Circassians to see women riding
in the European fashion was most amusing. Native women, when they
travel, ride like men. It was evidently a deep mystery to them how we
continued to keep on. They generally pulled up and watched us as long
as we remained in sight, expecting, probably hoping, we should ere long
fall off.</p>
<p class="par">One man was so absorbed in wonder that he lost his seat.
His horse made a sudden jump, and the rider fell so heavily, and with
such a crash, that we thought he must be killed. However, in a few
seconds, to our great relief, he jumped up, looking very crest-fallen
(for such an accident is accounted exceedingly disgraceful), and
climbed into his saddle amidst the jeers and laughter of his
companions.</p>
<p class="par">It may easily be supposed how delightful and interesting
we found the ride. But pleasures must come to an end; days are short in
these parts; evening was coming on, and it would be risking too much to
let darkness find us on such dangerous ground.</p>
<p class="par">Unwillingly, therefore, we had to content ourselves
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>with longing glances at the wild ravines that
branched upwards in all directions. The solitude, the gloom, the
inexpressible grandeur of the dark frowning rocks, the very danger,
gave an additional charm, and, like true women, we longed the more to
penetrate into the forbidden land.</p>
<p class="par">Fortunately we were all too much accustomed to mountain
travelling to feel nervous when traversing narrow and lofty ledges, for
it was decided that it would be more prudent to avoid the pass by which
we had entered, and so regain the town by a different route. Our guide,
therefore, led us up the face of a precipice by a pathway that looked
only fit for goats, but the clever little horses made their way with a
steadiness and skill beyond praise, and of which all the cavalcade
could not boast, for at one or two uncommonly skeary places poor
Domenico lost heart and dismounted, preferring to trust to his own
powers of climbing, a very unwise proceeding on his part, for a horse
will often make his way safely where a man&rsquo;s nerve may completely
fail him.</p>
<p class="par">We found it better not to look down too much. When we
were occasionally able to do so, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>savage wildness of
the scene was inexpressibly grand, especially at one point where, on
turning sharply round the shoulder of an almost perpendicular rock, we
found ourselves hanging as it were over a chasm black as night itself,
and where, at an immense depth beneath, we could hear the roar and
chafing of waters, though the torrent itself was invisible in the
darkness of the depth below.</p>
<p class="par">Slowly and carefully we made our way down the steep side
of the ravine, until we arrived at the bed of the stream that was to
serve as road to take us back into the hill country. At this season the
brown, turbid current, though it roared angrily over the many rocks and
stones that impeded its course, was not deep, and, after the slipping
and climbing we had had for the last hour, it was quite pleasant only
to have to wade through water, notwithstanding the occasional
splashings that it entailed.</p>
<p class="par">This gorge was quite as narrow as that by which we had
entered, and on emerging from its darkness and gloom into the
brightness and verdure of the hills, we felt as Dante must have done
when he returned to earth from his visit to the Inferno. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The stream partook of the character of the scene, and
soon after entering the grassy plains and verdant woods became a pretty
rippling river, though the masses of stones on each side its bed showed
that its violence could be again excited by the winter rains.</p>
<p class="par">A few versts from the town, on a steep grass bank,
shaded by a picturesque group of beech, was a very pretty wooden house
(the only habitation we had seen all day), something like a large Swiss
<i>chalet</i>. The mother and family of the late Prince Dimitri
Sherwasidzi, who died a few months ago, live here. The ladies, dressed
in deep mourning, were sitting in the broad verandah. They wore black
woollen robes, and had veils of the same sombre material wrapped round
their heads. The dress was most funereal. The tall, slender women, with
their gloomy drapery, that hung around them in heavy but graceful
folds, looked like figures from a Greek frieze. Mourning here is very
rigid. For three months after the death of the head of a family, the
ladies see no visitors excepting near relatives. Every week the
Princess Sherwasidzi, attended by her women, visits the grave of her
son. For several <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>hours they weep and mourn, casting ashes
upon their heads with lamentable cries and screams.</p>
<p class="par">Standing a little apart from the family dwelling is
another similar but smaller house, entirely devoted to the
entertainment of guests. Hospitality is much esteemed and largely
practised by the upper class of Circassians. No greater praise can be
awarded than to say that a man &ldquo;keeps forty tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The ride back in the cool evening was very pleasant, but
devoid of incident, with the exception of seeing our poor Domenico sent
flying over his horse&rsquo;s head. After having so well surmounted all
the little difficulties of the day, his horse stumbled over a sand
hillock, and this inglorious somersault was the result. Happily no harm
was done beyond a torn coat, but the Cossacks were immensely delighted
at his discomfiture. Even the grim old corporal gave his grey moustache
a pull to hide the unwonted smile in which he indulged. <span class=

<p class="par first">Our life here is full of quaint contrasts&mdash;a
curious mixture of wildness and civilisation. The days are passed in
wild rides amidst the hills and mountains, the dash of danger that
attends them adding zest to the interest of seeing scenery, magnificent
in the sublimity of its savage grandeur, and exquisitely lovely in the
tender beauty of its sequestered valleys and fern-clad forests.</p>
<p class="par">At eight o&rsquo;clock the scene changes, and we find
ourselves in the midst of a most kind and agreeable little society,
where music and dancing and merry talk make the hours pass much too
quickly. The little world of Soukoum is of course very limited, but it
comprises so many charming and clever people that one cannot help
regretting that some of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>them should, like the flowers in
the desert, be destined to bloom so far away from the more frequented
haunts of men.</p>
<p class="par">General B&mdash;&mdash;, the Governor, is unmarried, but
the Admiral&rsquo;s young wife, Madame G&mdash;&mdash;, aided by her
pretty sister, Mlle. Olga J&mdash;&mdash;, contrives to make her rough
Circassian house as attractive as if it were in Paris or St.
Petersburg.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; is an excellent musician, and Count
S&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s mazurkas and valses are so brilliant that a
dancing spirit invariably comes upon all who hear them. Then there is a
doctor, the merriest of men, who plays heartrending melodies upon the
flute. Unluckily, however, in the midst of the plaintive death-strains
of Edgardo and Desdemona, we catch sight of the brightest pair of
little black Tartar eyes, twinkling with such a droll expression over
the music, that instead of crying we all begin to laugh, which, it must
be admitted, spoils the effect the musician intended to produce.</p>
<p class="par">Last, though not least amongst our kind and charming
friends, is the Princess Constantine S&mdash;&mdash;, a young Russian
from Moscow, who has lately married the brother of the reigning Prince
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>Abasia. Very young, very pretty, and accustomed
to the luxuries and gaieties of a capital, she has accepted the
difficulties of her life here with a good sense and with a sweetness of
temper that have already done wonders in her Circassian household.</p>
<p class="par">The Prince was, unfortunately for us, with his brother
at Shamshesherai during our stay at Soukoum, but the friendly, even
affectionate hospitality we received from Princess Constantine and her
family, while it gave increased charm to our visit, added much to the
pain we felt when the time came for saying the cruel word,
&ldquo;farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">How often we have thought since of the merry hours we
spent together in that barn-like house. Though pretty outside, from the
climbing plants and fine trees by which it was shaded, it would be
difficult to find anything more comfortless than the interior. Great
bare rooms, without ceilings, and where the rats sometimes run across
the rafters, a general untidiness, and often also a want of
cleanliness, make Circassian houses, though the owners may be very
wealthy, anything but inviting to a foreigner. Princess Constantine and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>her mother had effected many improvements,
especially with regard to cleanliness and order, but still the aspect
of her home was cheerless in the extreme.</p>
<p class="par">The salon was a large, whitewashed room, containing a
table, a couple of sofas, and a few chairs that seemed to add to the
dreariness of the long wall against which they were arranged; but there
was a good piano, though unhappily it had occasionally to serve as
sideboard and as a stand for several books.</p>
<p class="par">The Princess&rsquo;s bedroom was somewhat more
furnished, though scarcely more comfortable. The wooden planks of which
the walls were made let in the wind through every joint, so that
immense Persian rugs were stretched round the bed to keep off the
intrusive breezes.</p>
<p class="par">The dressing-table was like an oasis in the desert, so
gay was it with lace and muslin; its grand gold toilette-service and
looking-glass, set with rubies, seeming quite out of place in so
comfortless an apartment.</p>
<p class="par">The walls were hung with the Prince&rsquo;s magnificent
arms and accoutrements. Some of the high-peaked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>Abasian saddles were very gorgeous, being
covered with crimson velvet embroidered with gold. The arms would have
excited the envy of many a Parisian &ldquo;elegant,&rdquo; so fine was
the temper of the sword-blades and daggers, and so beautiful were the
jewelled hilts and scabbards.</p>
<p class="par">The poor Princess gave a half-melancholy, half-ludicrous
account of her first arrival from Moscow, and of her despair at the
poverty-stricken, desolate appearance of her new home.</p>
<p class="par">She has by degrees succeeded in introducing a little
more order and comfort in the household, and hopes some day to have
furniture; but in the present unsettled state of affairs, it is thought
more prudent to avoid anything like display or expense.</p>
<p class="par">She tells us that her brother-in-law, Prince Michael,
who, besides being very rich, has also a salary from Russia as Governor
of Abasia, keeps up a considerable amount of state at
Shamshesherai.</p>
<p class="par">The ladies of the family, though nominally Christians,
retain nevertheless many of their Mohammedan customs. They never appear
in public unveiled, and though allowed to see their male relatives,
they lead a very secluded life, apart from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>men,
passing their time in smoking, making sweetmeats, and arranging their
dresses. They receive little or no education, and speak neither Russ
nor any other European language.</p>
<p class="par">Our friend tells us that although very great beauties
are sometimes seen, yet in her opinion Circassian women are not
generally good-looking, and that the Abasians are decidedly plain.
Certainly at present we have not seen one native woman with any claims
to beauty.</p>
<p class="par">The national dress, also, does not heighten their
charms. They usually wear loose Turkish trousers, made of white cotton,
and a peculiarly frightful upper garment of some dark cloth, made
precisely like the coats worn by High Church clergymen&mdash;tight and
straight, and buttoned from the throat to the feet. A striped shawl is
sometimes twisted round them like an apron. A blue gauze veil is thrown
over the head, and their hair, which is generally long and thick, is
worn in two heavy plaits that hang down behind.</p>
<p class="par">The beauties who obtain such great reputation in
Constantinople and the West almost invariably come from Georgia and the
valleys near El-Barouz. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href=
"#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>those districts the women have
magnificent eyes and fair complexions.</p>
<p class="par">It must be admitted, also, that we have arrived too late
in the season to see the good-looking girls. In short, they have all
been sold.</p>
<p class="par">Early in the year certain traders arrive from time to
time, and it is rumoured that Circassian parents do not object to
dispose of their daughters for a consideration. It is said also that
the fair damsels themselves, far from making difficulties, are
delighted to escape from the tedium of home-life, and to take their
chance of being purchased by a rich pasha.</p>
<p class="par">Although Prince Constantine&rsquo;s house was so badly
furnished, so devoid of ordinary comforts, still there was a sort of
Eastern grandeur in the multitude of servants and retainers who were
attached to the household.</p>
<p class="par">Land here is almost valueless, for Nature is so
bountiful that her wild fruits, and a little Indian corn, with the
addition of poultry that seem to feed and take care of themselves,
amply suffice for the support of the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="par">A great man&rsquo;s wealth is, therefore, estimated by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>the number of serfs he possesses, rather than by
the extent of his territory.</p>
<p class="par">The serfs are bound to supply their lord with a certain
quantity of wood, poultry, and service, the latter duty being generally
compounded for by one of the family becoming a permanent servant or
workman in the household of their prince. The lord, on his side,
bestows land and protection on his retainers.</p>
<p class="par">Serfdom is not so galling here as it was in Russia, for
the owner has no power, or at any rate it is not the custom, to sell
his serfs; he may remove them from one part of his property to another,
but even such a measure would be considered tyrannical.</p>
<p class="par">In fact, serfdom in Circassia very much resembles
clanship as it was in old times in Scotland. Each man is proud of his
connection with his chief, and the chief considers himself bound to
protect and avenge the wrongs of his followers.</p>
<p class="par">Like the old Scottish chieftains, also, the Circassian
princes, though possessing numerous bodies of retainers, and often vast
tracts of country, are but scantily supplied with coin, and have but
little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>means at their disposal for the due education of
their sons, or for enabling them to obtain the cultivation of mind, as
well as manners, that can be gained by seeing other countries.</p>
<p class="par">From time to time the Emperor summons some of the young
men to St. Petersburg. They there receive a certain amount of training
and education, but like most half-civilised people, the young princes
are, with few exceptions, so devoted to the wild life they have been
accustomed to lead amidst their native mountains, that going to St.
Petersburg is by no means popular.</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps, also, it is considered but as another name for
banishment; for occasionally, when the reigning family is supposed to
be too influential, pretexts have easily been found for retaining the
young heirs at the Russian Court.</p>
<p class="par">The Prince of M&mdash;&mdash; and his mother have thus
been for years in Russia, in spite of all their efforts to obtain
permission to return to their own country. They remain in a sort of
honourable captivity, receiving a large pension, while their estates at
home are managed by the Russian Government.</p>
<p class="par">The Princess, we were told, is a woman of remarkable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>talent and of very enlightened views. By her
judicious measures she had effected considerable improvement amongst
her people, but, unhappily for her, she was some years ago suspected,
or accused, of corresponding with Schamyl, and was therefore at once
removed from temptation. Her palace and gardens were at one time
renowned for their beauty, but during the occupation of the country by
the Turks, the palace was plundered and the gardens were destroyed,
though Omar Pasha did his best to save them.</p>
<p class="par">The invading army was on the whole harmless compared
with the lawless bands of camp-followers, who, hovering on the flanks
and rear of the Turkish troops, ravaged the unfortunate country,
burning and destroying as they passed, when they found no more booty
was to be obtained.</p>
<p class="par">A few days after our arrival, we were painfully reminded
of the insecurity of the country, by the intelligence that the body of
a soldier had been found in the pretty valley we had crossed on our
ride towards the mountains.</p>
<p class="par">A party had been sent out to cut firewood; the
unfortunate man strayed away from his comrades, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>and
was missing when the detachment returned. His body was discovered this
morning, shot through the head with a Circassian bullet. Though
nominally in possession of the Russians, Circassia is still in a very
disturbed state. The mountain fastnesses are held by the Circassians,
and until roads are made, morasses drained, and the plains and valleys
that lie between the mountains and the sea are inhabited and
cultivated, predatory bands can traverse the country at their will,
making it unsafe for any foreigner to venture beyond the protection of
the Russian forts and pickets.</p>
<p class="par">Even strangers can see that Circassia, like a lovely
wild animal, must be tamed rather than beaten, and that roads and
harbours will avail far more towards her complete subjection than the
intimidating presence of a vast standing army.</p>
<p class="par">Though the Abasians have now for some years been Russian
subjects, their sympathies are with their highland brethren, and it is
well known that they aid and abet the guerilla war that so incessantly
harasses the district. The Russian officers declare that this species
of hidden warfare is most trying to the troops. It brings neither
honour nor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>profit, and the hatred that is felt by the
Circassians is heartily returned by their conquerors.</p>
<p class="par">In Georgia this ill-feeling does not exist. The people
have shown themselves much more amenable to foreign rule. The Georgians
are more indolent and less warlike than their neighbours in Circassia,
and also have a great tie with Russia in being members of the same
church.</p>
<p class="par">The religion of the Circassians is shrouded in much
mystery. Apparently they acknowledge no Supreme Being, they have no
saints, nor do they observe any sacred days. Sometimes they sacrifice a
chicken, though to whom, or for what, nobody knows. Some profess,
however, a species of Mohammedanism, though they are absolutely
disowned by all good Moslems, who consider such co-religionists a
disgrace, and call them heretics and pagans of the worst description.
They are amongst the few people in the world who make use of no sort of
ceremony, even on occasion of a marriage. A certain price having been
covenanted for, the father takes his daughter to her new home, and
there leaves her, having received the gun, or horse, for which she is
considered the fair equivalent. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251"
href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>mountain woman is valuable,
as she is an excellent beast of burden, and a very hard-working
slave.</p>
<p class="par">From all we hear of the mountaineers, they seem to be a
haughty, reserved people, proud of their poverty, of their unspotted
lineage, and of their dauntless courage. Loving their wild country with
passionate devotion, no reverses dishearten them. War is both their
duty and their happiness, and at the cry of such a leader as Schamyl,
they flock eagerly around his standard, prepared to suffer or to die in
defence of their beloved prince, and of the wild liberty that is far
dearer to them than life.</p>
<p class="par">Few characters of modern days are invested with such
romantic interest&mdash;nay, even at one time, with such mysterious
interest&mdash;as that of Schamyl. Born in prosaic modern times, his
life presents all the attributes of the hero of the middle ages.
Endowed with personal beauty and strength rare even amongst the hardy
tribe of which he was the chief, Nature had bestowed upon him another
gift, yet more precious. She had given him the rare tact, the wondrous
charm that wins personal love, and that enables men, and sometimes
women, to rule mankind with absolute power. It is that love
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>which makes men rush to death with heroic
rapture, eager to shed their blood at the bidding of their beloved
leader. The very faults also in Schamyl&rsquo;s character endeared him
to his followers, or rather he adroitly contrived that they should be
the means of binding his people still more closely to him.</p>
<p class="par">Naturally of a morbid and melancholy disposition, he was
at times subject to gusts of stormy passion that awed and subdued all
those who witnessed the terrific bursts of rage which transformed the
stern, calm man into a wrathful demon. Woe to him who aroused the dread
spirit! The strongest men quailed before the furious glance, the mighty
arm of their terrible chief. It is reasonable to suppose that these
outbursts were but the effects of insanity, for during one attack of
ferocious rage the unhappy man slew his young wife and infant child, to
both of whom he had been tenderly attached. It is said that though in
after-years many other wives filled his harem, never again did any
woman gain that place in his heart which had been occupied by the young
girl whom he had done to death with his own hand. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Not only did the great strength and wild fury of Schamyl
awe his people into subjection, he skilfully led them to believe that
on him the mantle of the Prophet had descended, and that in spirit he
was constantly conveyed to the presence of the Almighty, there to
receive the commands of the Divine Will. The wild ravings, therefore,
that fell from his lips were treasured by his followers as direct
communications from heaven.</p>
<p class="par">Schamyl no doubt possessed sufficient control over
himself to have some method in his madness, and contrived that his
sentences should convey threats, encouragement, and orders calculated
to strengthen his power amongst wild and independent people. It is
difficult to ascertain, from the many conflicting statements, whether
he was a Mohammedan or not; probably he found a certain amount of
religious fervour of great utility in augmenting his influence amongst
the more distant tribes, and he succeeded in making them believe in him
as in a leader directly inspired by Heaven.</p>
<p class="par">However visionary may have been Schamyl&rsquo;s claims
to be a great prophet, there is no doubt that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>his
talents as a soldier and as a politician were of a very high order.</p>
<p class="par">The dark hour passed, who so thoughtful for his
people&mdash;who so tender to his soldiers as this wild mountaineer? It
is related of him that he often tended the wounded and sick with his
own hand. He lived amidst his troops, sharing their privations and
their danger, and was ever foremost in the fight. He rushed to the
attack with a confidence that inspired his followers with unlimited
faith, and for years it was believed that whenever Schamyl led in
person victory was certain.</p>
<p class="par">Besides this dauntless courage, all the Russian generals
agree that he was a great and skilful strategist. Possessing a thorough
knowledge of his native mountains, his positions were chosen with
consummate judgment, and rarely did he make an attack unless fairly
certain of the result. For years did he baffle the strong force and the
renowned generals that Russia sent against him.</p>
<p class="par">From his stronghold of Dargi-Vedenna, in Daghistan, he
issued his mandates, which were carried out with unquestioning
obedience by the devoted tribes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"
href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At length time, unceasing attacks, and the tremendous
power of money and strength began to tell. What could a few poor,
brave, diminishing highland tribes do against the mighty Empire of All
the Russias? The extent of Schamyl&rsquo;s dominions dwindled to the
barren, bleak mountain sides in the heart of the Caucasus; but here his
stronghold seemed impregnable, and but for treachery, perhaps, he might
still be reigning in his wild mountain fortress. In an evil hour for
him, he admitted to his friendship a foreigner, who basely betrayed the
trust reposed in him, and, after months of starvation and suffering,
the noble old warrior and the remains of his band were delivered over
to captivity.</p>
<p class="par">To the credit of the Russian Government, their prisoners
were treated with the utmost kindness and consideration, and Schamyl
has found a friend in the Czar, and a home at the Russian Court.</p>
<p class="par">For the benefit of the country itself, it is greatly to
be desired that Russia should speedily obtain possession of the whole
of Circassia, and its adjacent provinces, but all the romantic
sympathies of one&rsquo;s nature are stirred by the history of the few
poor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>brave men who fought to the death to preserve
their liberty in their wild mountain homes.</p>
<p class="par">Though the tribes who more immediately owned
Schamyl&rsquo;s supremacy have been mainly destroyed, there are still
many others who are as thorns in the sides of the Government.</p>
<p class="par">The very fact of so distinguished a commander as General
B&mdash;&mdash; being appointed to Soukoum is ominous of more than
usual danger and difficulty. His presence denotes that there are grave
apprehensions entertained that another desperate effort may be made by
some of the most disaffected. It is earnestly to be hoped that the
threatening storm may be averted in time. Such outbursts are most
disastrous, and until they can be effectually checked no permanent
improvement can be made in this lovely country.</p>
<p class="par">Not only is General B&mdash;&mdash; a brave and
distinguished soldier, he is a kind, generous-hearted man, and having
passed the greater part of his life in the Caucasus, knows both the
country and its many dialects thoroughly.</p>
<p class="par">He has held several military commands, and has also been
employed diplomatically both in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>Turkey and Persia, for he has
the rare talent of speaking six Eastern languages, besides French,
German, and Russ.</p>
<p class="par">General B&mdash;&mdash; is by birth a Livonian, but has
not seen his native country for nearly thirty years. He is now quite
acclimated, and settled here, and not only have the wild beauties of
his adopted home become very dear to him, but he also loves the stormy,
adventurous life he leads. General B&mdash;&mdash; speaks in the
highest terms of Prince Bariatinsky, who, he considers, has done more
for Russia and for Russian interests in the last few years than any of
the other commanders-in-chief have succeeded in doing for upwards of
fifty.</p>
<p class="par">Besides being an excellent soldier, the Prince is also a
forbearing and judicious governor. The conciliatory measures he has
adopted with the inhabitants of the conquered places have done much
(especially in Georgia) towards establishing a friendly feeling between
them and the Russian Government, and should this good understanding
gain ground, and the distracted people once really know the blessings
of peace, Russia may hope to see the country that has so long been
merely a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>battle-field, costing treasures of blood and
money, converted into a very mine of wealth, yielding abundance of corn
and cattle from her rich valleys, and a mighty harvest of minerals from
the vast storehouse of her mountains. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">We endeavoured to return in a small way the kind
hospitality of our friends by having a little <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> on board. Breakfast was prepared on
deck, we arranged quantities of roses and ferns round the masts, and
the yacht was dressed out gaily with all her flags. As the Governor
came on board, the Russian ensign was hoisted at the fore, and when our
friends left us, the <i>Claymore&rsquo;s</i> four little cannon fired a
salute, with much military, or rather naval, precision.</p>
<p class="par">The modest roar of our diminutive weapons had scarcely
subsided when the huge guns of the Russian frigate bellowed forth the
answering salute, then flash after flash came in rapid succession from
the other vessels, until the air was filled with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>warlike sounds. Long after the report was over,
the distant thunder was heard muttering fainter and fainter as it
rolled from cavern to cavern amongst the hills and valleys, as if it
had awakened all the sleeping echoes of the mountains.</p>
<p class="par">The more we see of this country, the more we are
enraptured with its great and varied beauties. But beautiful as we find
it now, every one tells us we can hardly form an idea of its loveliness
when arrayed in its garment of spring flowers. Then the earth is
carpeted with violets, narcissus, bluebells, cyclamen, and the
many-coloured iris, while the sides of the hills glow with the red,
pink, and lilac blossoms of rhododendrons and azaleas.</p>
<p class="par">Wherever we walk and ride, we see the wild vine growing
luxuriantly amongst the trees (its long branches often covered with
fruit), making delicate green arches and canopies in the darker shade
of the woods. The grapes are small, and not so sweet as when
cultivated, but the slightly acid flavour is very agreeable in a hot
climate. It is sad to see the bunches decaying on the vines, for the
people never take the trouble of gathering them to dry for winter
consumption. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Day by day the feeling of pain grows stronger to see
that, while Nature has been so generous, so profuse in her valuable
gifts, man will not even take the trouble to avail himself of the
luxuries she offers with so lavish a hand.</p>
<p class="par">Undeterred by the sad fate of the poor soldier, and
confident in the valour of the gallant Cossacks and of the Russian
officers who accompanied us, we made as many rides as possible in the
neighbourhood of the town, but it was in vain to look with longing eyes
towards the mountains. They were pronounced unsafe, and we dared not
venture near them. Still the hilly low ground was so wondrously lovely
that we could have ridden for months instead of days, and have found
fresh beauties to charm us. The last ride we can never forget, perhaps
because it had the sad charm of being the last&mdash;because we knew
that each long lingering glance would never be renewed, that our eyes
would never again rest upon the marvellous beauties of form and
colouring that were lying in such abundant loveliness around us.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after leaving the town we skirted a long narrow
valley that gradually inclined towards the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>hills. We were riding through masses of fern,
that began here and there to show a few bright autumnal tints. On the
grassy slopes above and below were groups of magnificent trees, their
long shadows almost stretching across the valley. Far away to the left
the giant mountains reared their lofty heads, great dark lines marking
the many ravines that scored their rugged sides.</p>
<p class="par">So still was the air, so absolute was the hush of
evening, that not a bush rustled, not a leaf moved in the great calm.
We could only hear the tinkle of a little brook as it ran merrily
amongst the brushwood beneath, and as we occasionally stopped to
listen, there came the faint murmur of many a distant streamlet, as it
threaded its way through the far away valleys and passes of the
mountains.</p>
<p class="par">The sun, that had been very oppressive before we entered
the valley, now only glowed upon the tops of the hills, making the
trees and rocks on one side quiver in the flood of light, while all was
cool and fresh around us.</p>
<p class="par">We pursued our way through fern and underwood, up hill
and down, sometimes crossing the little stream that rippled with a
thousand pleasant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263"
name="pb263">263</a>]</span>voices over shining stones and gravel, then
again entering a thick wood, where the trees grew so closely together
that the sunbeams in vain attempted to pierce the interlaced boughs
above, and where we had to bend low over our horses&rsquo; necks to
avoid the masses of climbing plants that hung like ropes from the
branches of the trees, until we arrived at an open space or plateau on
the summit of a steep hill, and here we had a view as beautiful as it
was extensive.</p>
<p class="par">In this lovely region the atmosphere is so transparent
that space seems almost annihilated. The eye travels far into the deep
blue distance, tracing peak after peak in the wondrous clearness, until
at length sky and mountain are blended into one line of quivering
light, and the sight, fatigued with the magnitude and remoteness of
objects on the vast horizon, seeks rest by gazing on the tender green
of the fair valleys spread so invitingly around.</p>
<p class="par">Far, far away, glittering with dazzling whiteness, was
the range of mighty snow-mountains, some of the nearer peaks frowning
majestically above the sombre masses of the great pine forests that
stretch for more than a hundred miles into the interior of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the
country. The chain of the Caucasus is considerably more lofty than that
of the Alps. The highest point of El-Barouz is rather more than 2,000
feet higher than Mont Blanc; but from the climate being so much warmer,
there is apparently less eternal snow here than in Switzerland.</p>
<p class="par">The valleys very much resemble those of the Tyrol, near
Botzen. The same rich pastures, the same fertilizing streams, sunny
slopes, and wooded hills are found here, but, unlike happy Tyrol, in
the sister vales of Circassia not a house is to be found, and, unless a
warlike band should pass, not a human being may be met with for
hours.</p>
<p class="par">During this day&rsquo;s ride the only man we saw was a
goatherd, who, fully armed with sword and gun, was tending his flock of
Circassian goats. These pretty creatures, smaller than those of Greece
and Syria, are covered with long delicate hair, with which the Abasian
women make many fine stuffs. The man was sitting under a tree up which
a vine had climbed, and the ripe grapes were hanging in great clusters,
high on the upper branches. Seeing that we looked both thirsty and
tired, with the courtesy of a true gentleman and mountaineer, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>threw down gun and sword, climbed the tree with
the activity of a squirrel, and in a few minutes descended, laden with
bunches of the lovely purple fruit, which he offered us with a grace of
manner both simple and dignified. We had come into his native woods,
and with the easy bearing of a stately host he offered his guests the
best refreshment in his power. He then showed us his matchlock, of
which he seemed not a little proud. It was made of beautifully-polished
walnut wood, had scarcely any stock, and was so small that it looked
like a pretty child&rsquo;s toy.</p>
<p class="par">Like most mountaineers, the Circassians are excellent
marksmen. They fire very quickly, so much so that they scarcely appear
to take aim. On horseback they are equally at home, and load and fire
with the greatest rapidity when at full gallop. War with them makes the
delight as well as the occupation of their lives. They despise and
avoid every sort of domestic and agricultural employment, and consider
even hunting, unless in pursuit of some dangerous animal, beneath manly
dignity.</p>
<p class="par">To make the boys hardy and independent, as soon as they
are old enough to sit on horseback they are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>sent
to some friend&rsquo;s house, in order to be completely removed from
the enervating influence of home. Here they remain several years, only
occasionally visiting their parents. During this period they are taught
warlike exercises, and are encouraged to encounter every description of
danger and fatigue. Often are these hardy lads sent into the mountains
during the severest winter weather to pass their days in the saddle,
their only shelter at night a cave or an overhanging rock, their only
food the roots of grasses and herbs.</p>
<p class="par">No wonder that the Russians find it hard to subdue men
who not only from their earliest youth have been thus inured to
hardship, hunger, and thirst, but are also entrenched amidst the
wildest of mountain fastnesses&mdash;fastnesses that can only be
reached by many days&rsquo; journey through forests and over morasses,
where vegetation grows with such rank luxuriance that few would
encounter willingly the dangerous miasma that reigns there nearly all
the year.</p>
<p class="par">Besides weaving woollen stuffs for clothing, the women
of Abasia and Georgia make very pretty striped shawls and rugs from the
long hair of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267"
name="pb267">267</a>]</span>Circassian goat. They also excel in dyes,
the colours mostly used, red and dark blue, being exceedingly fine in
shade. The red is clear and brilliant, and the blue is quite free from
the black dingy hue of the cloth worn by the Fellah women in Egypt, but
is like a dark shade of the bright &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Imp&eacute;ratrice</span>&rdquo; blue. They also make the crimson
boots or slippers that are worn alike by both sexes. The manufacture is
very simple: the skins are scraped, tanned, and then dyed. The boots
are cut out in a single piece and sewn up in front, the seam being
lined with a narrow strip of leather. They are then thoroughly soaked
in a mixture of resinous gum and water, which makes them nearly
waterproof, and the owner should wear them thus wet for a few hours.
The process is not very agreeable, but has its reward, inasmuch as the
boots then take the exact shape of the feet, and fit with the
pliability and comfort of a glove.</p>
<p class="par">The women have besides a very ingenious way of carving
beads. A long piece of wood, dyed red or black, is pierced lengthways
by a heated wire. It is shaped either into an octagon, or is smoothed
round. Then, with a knife and heated needles, it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>cut
and engraved into various patterns. Considerable taste is often shown
in the designs, many of them being remarkably intricate and pretty.
When the wand is sufficiently decorated, the beads are sliced off the
size required. Beyond these primitive ornaments, we could not hear of
any other <i>articles de luxe</i> being manufactured in Abasia.</p>
<p class="par">In Georgia there are native jewellers, who make both
gold and silver ornaments, and we saw some bracelets and necklaces made
of gold that seemed very pure. The designs were also good, but the
workmanship was coarse and ill-finished, and far inferior to the
jewellery both of Persia and India.</p>
<p class="par">But now the day had come when we must leave this
fairy-like Eastern land&mdash;this earthly Paradise, where war,
suffering, and trouble have taken such deep root. Perhaps, were it
happy, peaceful, and prosperous, one would care for it less, for
prosperity and riches have little need of sympathy, and can always
ensure plenty of friends, whereas a poor people and a distracted
country are thankful to accept all the friendship that may be bestowed
upon them.</p>
<p class="par">It may appear like exaggeration to say what real
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>pain also it was to part from such newly-made
friends, but we must have had very cold hearts not to have been touched
by the great, unmerited kindness we had received. So now we must say
good-bye to the joyous rides, to the merry evenings, that kindly
intercourse has made so pleasant, and can only look forward, in
exchange, to many a rough day and night on the stormy waves of the
Black Sea.</p>
<p class="par">As usual in this world, past pleasures must be paid for
by some pain, and our visit here has been both so charming and so
interesting, that we have been beguiled into making a stay somewhat
longer than warranted by strict prudence.</p>
<p class="par">Autumn brings many a storm to this easily-excited sea,
and we shall be fortunate if we get back to the Bosphorus, or
Sevastopol, without a &ldquo;streak,&rdquo; as it is called, of bad
weather. At present, however, all looks fair and sunny, the wind is
favourable, to-night therefore we leave. Our friends accompanied us to
the shore, and the last cordial hand-shake was given.</p>
<p class="par">When we arrived on board the yacht we found that kind
thoughts for us had already preceded us <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>there. Flowers,
grapes, music, drawings&mdash;everything they thought could add to our
comfort or pleasure&mdash;had been sent on board by these kind
people.</p>
<p class="par">The anchor was up, the sails were set, the yacht was
only lying-to until we embarked. The sea was as smooth as glass, the
light of the rising moon covered the mountains with a tender veil, as
we glided slowly away from Soukoum. Not a sound broke the silence of
the night but the gentle wash of the water against the bows of the
vessel. A soft breeze just filled the sails, and with really sad hearts
we watched landmark after landmark disappear, until, on rounding the
headland of the bay, the last light of the little town was shut out,
and we said farewell, probably for ever, to the loveliest spot we have
ever seen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">SINOPE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">After leaving Soukoum we had three days of fine
weather, though the winds had been somewhat capricious and baffling.
Still we had done well, having had a run of 102 miles during the first
twenty-four hours, and of 86 during the next; but on the 24th of
September the wind began to moan ominously, and a thick fog was drawing
up to windward like a curtain. The sea began to heave up and down with
a sort of heavy, sullen motion, as if gathering its strength before a
battle of the elements began.</p>
<p class="par">Under these circumstances, and having a wish also to see
Sinope, we resolved to go there, rather than brave the threatening
gale. The helm was therefore put up, and about seven p.m. we made out
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>one high and two low islands, which, on nearer
approach, resolved themselves into a very narrow isthmus, that,
stretching far away into the sea, terminated in a steep rocky
promontory.</p>
<p class="par">On the neck of the isthmus stands Sinope, commanding a
beautiful view of the long range of mountains and wooded hills that
line the coast. The town itself is a quaint place, tightly squeezed
into some old castellated walls, with a fierce little pepper-box of a
fort at each corner. Outside the town, a long straggling Greek suburb
runs up the hill for a considerable distance, its low red and brown
houses looking very picturesque amongst the groups of cypress and
fig-trees. The roadstead, though open and exposed to the east, has the
reputation of being perfectly secure, and we find ourselves in quite a
little crowd of Greek, Turkish, Austrian, and Russian vessels. It
seems, therefore, that others besides ourselves have had forebodings of
bad weather, and have taken refuge in this, the only safe anchorage on
the southern side of the Black Sea. It is singular, however, that the
anchorage should be so safe, for it is difficult to believe that a
heavy sea would not set into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273"
href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>bay, should the wind come
from any quarter between north-east and south. It is said, however,
that a vessel has never been known to be driven from her anchor; so the
only solution is that these winds never blow here with violence.
Certainly during our stay, though a tremendous sea was running about a
mile or two out, but little swell ever came up to the anchorage.</p>
<p class="par">On the morning after our arrival, an intimation came
from the Pasha (one of the Sultan&rsquo;s numerous brothers-in-law),
that he wished to pay us a visit. Soon after twelve his Highness
arrived, attended by a very numerous suite, and accompanied by a Greek
gentleman, the Austrian consul.</p>
<p class="par">We were somewhat dismayed at the sight of such a goodly
company, as our little cabins could not possibly accommodate so large a
party of guests, and a Turk of high rank does not like to remain on
deck. All were anxious to come below; it was therefore somewhat
difficult to prevent undue crowding, for the Pasha was so interested in
all he saw, that he insisted upon visiting every part of the vessel. He
appeared an exceedingly intelligent man, and had a vivacity of manner
somewhat unusual in a Turk. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When the cakes and sweetmeats appeared they were
accompanied by champagne and liqueurs, both of which beverages were
highly approved of. Happily by the laws of the Koran they are not
considered wine, and the champagne was drunk in tumblers without any
hesitation.</p>
<p class="par">As the Governor descended into his state barge, manned
by ten rowers in grand but rather dirty crimson jackets and fezzes, the
yacht gave him the proper salute of fifteen guns, a compliment that was
promptly returned by a Turkish man-of-war, to the intense joy of all
the little boys in the town, who came flocking out of numberless narrow
streets and alleys in an astonishing variety of dress, or rather
undress.</p>
<p class="par">Later in the day we proceeded to make a little tour
round the town.</p>
<p class="par">Sinope is divided into two parts, one inhabited by
Turks, the other by Greeks.</p>
<p class="par">The streets in the Greek quarter do not deserve the
name. They are little better than rough water-courses, and are so
narrow that the overhanging eaves of the houses almost touch each
other. But what a wealth of picturesque beauty do these old
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>houses present to the eye of an artist! Built
entirely of wood, they are either painted a deep chocolate colour, or
are left to brown and blacken with age, whilst so much shadow is
lightened both by the great masses of moss or lichen that cling to the
roof, and by the bright green of the vines that half cover the
walls.</p>
<p class="par">The mode of building is peculiar. The frame is joined
together, and the roof is put on and finished. The walls are then made
by means of layers of shingles (long narrow pieces of wood), fastened
to the upright posts. These planks are of uneven length, and project
over each other in a confused irregularity, which though charming in a
sketch, leaves so many yawning crevices that each house must be a
veritable temple of the winds.</p>
<p class="par">The majority of the houses were much larger than might
have been expected in so small and poor a town; but sometimes as many
as ten or twelve families will live together, not in separate flats or
apartments, but as one household.</p>
<p class="par">It would seem as if in days of yore their ancestors must
have been bitten by tarantulas, for dancing is a perfect mania with the
Greeks here of all ages and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>classes. &ldquo;Young men and
maidens,&rdquo; old men and women, dance every evening, with an
animation and an unwearied delight that neither poverty nor age seems
able to diminish. Their principal aim, therefore, in building, is to
have a large &ldquo;salle de danse&rdquo; for winter use, and as soon
as this portion of the house is completed, the various families squeeze
themselves into a few little rooms, contentedly enduring gaping walls
and half-finished floors, so long as they have space for the beloved
Romaika.</p>
<p class="par">Though the houses are so crowded, they are nevertheless
beautifully clean. A constant scrubbing seems going on, a process,
strange to say, that is also extended to the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="par">The women are really lovely, their features having the
delicately cut outline that is so beautiful in the ancient Greek
statues. Many have exquisitely fair complexions, and we fell in love
immediately with their hair, for it had that dusky, half golden, half
red tint only seen in the tresses of the gorgeous beauties of Titian
and Georgione. It was a painful disenchantment to find that it owed its
beauty not to nature, but to henna&mdash;in fact it was dyed. So
enamoured are the Sinope women of this colour, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>that
even the babies in arms have their scanty little locks tinged with the
ruddy hue. Still, putting aside the disappointment of their hair, the
women were worthy of all the admiration we bestowed upon them. Not only
have they delicate features and complexions, but their eyes also are
unusually beautiful; large, lustrous and dark, without being black,
they have a tender, deprecating look that reminds one of the
inexpressibly touching expression seen in the eyes of the unhappy
Beatrice Cenci.</p>
<p class="par">It is a well-known saying that pretty women generally
dress well; either they adorn the dress, or the dress adorns them. The
Sinope beauties are no exception to the rule, and the gay costume adds
another attraction to the charms of the wearer.</p>
<p class="par">On a f&ecirc;te-day a Sinope belle puts a many-coloured
handkerchief over her head, which she ties as tightly as possible under
the chin, in order to make her cheeks look round and smooth. In this,
perhaps, she is a little mistaken, as ladies of other lands are who
tighten their waists by way of improving their figures. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Another handkerchief is twisted round the head, beneath
which the hair falls in two or three long thick plaits, while a few
little curls are coquettishly allowed to stray over the forehead.</p>
<p class="par">Her cloth jacket, of some bright colour, generally
scarlet, blue, or green, is half covered with a rich embroidery of
black or gold braid, and is left open in front, to show a full white
chemise that is drawn up closely round the throat. A short petticoat of
fringed silk, or a striped shawl of many colours is worn over large
Turkish trousers, the toilet being completed by a crimson scarf
fastened as a sash round the waist. Altogether it would be difficult to
find a more brilliant or becoming costume.</p>
<p class="par">The fair damsel also wears all her worldly wealth on her
head and neck, and hanging from her ears, in the shape of long strings
of gold or silver coins.</p>
<p class="par">Unlike their Turkish neighbours, therefore, the Sinope
Greeks have the inestimable advantage of being able to ascertain by the
same glance whether the fortune equals the fair face of the young
beauties amongst whom they have to select their wives.</p>
<p class="par">For the first time for some years we saw again,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>not only middle-aged women, but women of a
middle age, that were both well preserved and good-looking. In most
countries the men have their proper allowance of the complete <i>seven
ages</i>, but out of England, and in Eastern countries especially, it
is rare to find women of the poorer classes who have more than
three&mdash;namely, childhood, girlhood, and decrepit old age. From the
second to the third is only a step, and a young girl has scarcely
passed the bloom of early youth ere she changes in a marvellously short
time into a wrinkled, toothless, shrivelled old woman. It was really
refreshing to look at the good-looking women of <i>uncertain age</i> at
Sinope; they had such a bright, matronly, and, if the simile may be
used, such a sunshiny air about them.</p>
<p class="par">The people seemed wonderfully good-natured, and bestowed
upon us many nods and pleasant looks, as if they were really glad to
see strangers in their little town.</p>
<p class="par">Leaving the Greek quarter, we came to a broad, open
space, with a few groups of cypress scattered about&mdash;the Turkish
burial-ground, chosen with much taste, as is usually the case with
Turkish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>cemeteries. Placed on the narrowest part of the
isthmus that unites the promontory to the mainland, it commands lovely
views over both bays.</p>
<p class="par">We crossed a shaky draw-bridge, and, passing under an
old mouldering gateway, found ourselves in the Turkish town&mdash;in
the real region of true believers&mdash;not modern Turks, such as are
now mostly seen in Constantinople, in Frank dresses and polished boots,
but amongst grave, old-fashioned Moslems, arrayed in the flowing robes
and large decorous turbans of days gone by.</p>
<p class="par">The women, not nominally veiled in transparent and
becoming clouds of muslin, but closely wrapped in sheets of such
uncompromising calico that not even the tip of a nose could be seen,
glided about like spectres, occasionally stopping under the shadow of a
wall, to peep curiously at the unwonted spectacle of Christian women
passing through their streets.</p>
<p class="par">Finding ourselves in such an assemblage of &ldquo;The
Faithful,&rdquo; I became suddenly conscience-stricken on account of my
cambric morning gown, which was really very pretty, but unhappily of a
delicate <i>green</i>!! We could not but see the angry glances
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>cast on the objectionable shade, so, although
the evening was very oppressive, I hastened to hide myself as much as
possible under the folds of a large shawl, doing my best, therefore, to
prevent the scandal of the sacred colour being seen on an unbelieving
&ldquo;Giaour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Dried fish and tobacco seemed the staple commodities of
the place, and in spite of the exceeding cleanliness both of houses and
people, they cause an ancient and fish-like odour to linger in the
streets.</p>
<p class="par">Leaving the town by a gate opposite to that by which we
had entered, we found ourselves on the sea-shore. The big waves came
tumbling in on the beach in great angry masses, and as they poured back
again with a sullen roar, the old walls of the town seemed to quiver to
their foundations, as if many more high tides and stormy seas would
speedily lay them low. But old and tottering as they appear, they have
for nearly three centuries resisted the efforts of their enemy, and the
waves, by their own violence, have helped to make a little sand-bank
that now seems to protect the ancient walls from their too near
approach. The air was heavy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href=
"#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>and oppressive, giving that
sensation of nervous foreboding that so often precedes physical or
mental trouble. A long line of lurid clouds showed where the sun had
gone down with angry redness, and some very dark streaks on the grey
waters at the horizon seemed to say that to-morrow&rsquo;s rising would
be as stormy as to-night&rsquo;s farewell.</p>
<p class="par">The Austrian consul tells us that for some years
<i>the</i> storm of the year has always taken place during the last
week in September, the 26th being an especially fatal day. That
luckless period is now over, so we venture to hope that the muttering
tempest may but be moving on its way to other seas.</p>
<p class="par">Though the short twilight was scarcely over as we again
crossed the Greek quarter, not a soul was to be seen&mdash;not a light
glimmered at a window; every street was silent and deserted. After the
customary dance the people of Sinope, like the birds, go to bed with
the sun, and a feeling came over us as if we were guilty of some degree
of <i>fastness</i>, almost of dissipation, in not also being at home
and in bed, like other respectable people, though it was little past
eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p class="par">A few hours later the storm burst forth in good
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>earnest, and raged all night with great fury.
Towards morning the wind somewhat suddenly went down, but a tremendous
sea was running beyond the roadstead.</p>
<p class="par">Three large steamers put in soon after dawn. One of them
close by us presents a really pitiable spectacle. There are between
four and five hundred Persians on board, and the deck is a scene of
dirt and wretchedness such as would be difficult to find equalled. The
Persians will never separate from their luggage; they sit on their
goods all day and sleep on them all night. During the heavy sea
yesterday the waves washed completely over the vessel, drenching these
miserable creatures as well as their goods. From the deck being so
encumbered the water could not escape, and these wretched people were
lying for hours as in a bath, and in a frightful state of prostration
and suffering, the combined effects of terror and sea-sickness. Some of
them are now trying to dry their rags in the occasional gleams of
sunshine, and the ship is covered with sheep-skins, bits of old shawls,
carpets, and the complicated articles of clothing only known to Eastern
toilettes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As we wished to see the country, the Governor kindly
lent us horses, and, accompanied by the Austrian consul, we set out in
the afternoon for a ride. To do us still more honour, the Pasha had
also sent two of his body-guard to attend us. More villainous-looking
individuals it would have been difficult to find anywhere. Our
conviction was that they must have been, even if, as we hoped, they no
longer were, part of a robber-band. In that case they would prove far
more efficient protectors than any regular soldiers could be, as in all
probability they kept up friendly intercourse with their old
companions.</p>
<p class="par">Edmond About, in that witty and entertaining work,
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">La Gr&egrave;ce Contemporaine</span>,&rdquo;
gives one of his most amusing and clever descriptions, when he
represents the brigands and soldiers as being on such friendly terms
with each other that they take turns in claiming the victory in the
occasional little encounters that from time to time take place, in
order to keep up appearances, amicably dividing the spoil when the
affair is over.</p>
<p class="par">After paying a visit to the consul&rsquo;s wife, a
pretty little Venetian, with two bright-eyed children, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>we
mounted our horses, and passing through the Greek suburb, descended the
hill and turned towards the mainland.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after leaving the town, the country becomes barren,
though the soil itself seems rich, and would probably be exceedingly
fertile if well cultivated. Here and there were a few patches of corn,
but tobacco is the principal crop. Great bunches of the fragrant leaves
were hanging up to dry, suspended from poles in the middle of the
fields. The tobacco grown near the coast is considered remarkably good,
so we resolved to make some purchases for the benefit of smoking
friends at home, and bought a quantity of the very best the district
could produce for five piastres an oke. As there are eight piastres in
a shilling, and as an oke contains about two and a half English pounds,
it is hardly necessary to say how cheap this was. The same tobacco
costs in Constantinople from 70 to 100 piastres an oke. Under these
circumstances it seems wonderful that a regular trade should not be
established, but such is the inertness of the inhabitants that there is
no direct communication either with the capital or with Odessa, only an
occasional trader from time to time <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>putting in here.
There are no roads from the town into the interior; only sufficient
tobacco, therefore, is grown to supply the neighbouring villages.</p>
<p class="par">The country is undulating, and, cantering up a little
slope, we found ourselves on the summit of the cliffs that project into
the western bay. On three sides was the sea, on the fourth the
magnificent chain of mountains that run from the coast far into the
interior of Asia Minor.</p>
<p class="par">The day was wild and stormy; the sea broke with a deep,
hollow roar amongst the caverns of the rocks. Every now and then fierce
gusts of wind drove the clouds madly across the sky, but over the
mountains there lay a broad band of sunshine, lighting up the little
upland pastures, and making the patches of bright green still more
vivid in contrast with the dark shadow of the forests at their
feet.</p>
<p class="par">Riding along the cliffs we obtained an excellent view of
the singular position of Sinope. Built on a narrow strip of land,
scarcely a quarter of a mile broad, it commands the two bays, and
overlooks for many miles the undulating plain that stretches from the
coast to the foot of the mountains. In old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>times, when the town was fortified, it must have
been impregnable, both from sea and land; now the old castellated walls
are little more than ruins. One portion, the remains of an ancient
tower, said to have been part of the Palace of Mithridates, is
remarkably picturesque. The leafy branches of briers and hops now trail
across its old brickwork, and the tendrils of the wild caper have
clasped in tight embrace many a column and mass of sculptured marble
that lies lowly on the ground.</p>
<p class="par">Ever since we have been here, notwithstanding the kind
assistance of both Pasha and consul, we have had the greatest
difficulty in procuring meat, bread, or milk. We were surprised
therefore to see outside the town patches of grass that would have
afforded excellent pasturage both for sheep and cattle. But it seems,
in respect of <i>cow</i> government, Sinope is a republic, every cow
doing as seemeth good to herself. She goes out in the morning when she
likes, if in the evening it is borne on her mind that she would like to
be milked, she comes home, but should her maternal feelings be weak, or
should she wish to call upon her friends at a distance, she does not
return for a day or two. Under these circumstances <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>the
supply of milk is precarious, and as to the bread, it is of the most
primitive description. A coarse, dark-brown, nearly black meal is made
into a paste by mixing it with a little water. It is then rolled into
thin sheets about the size of a small round tea-table, and baked. When
quite fresh this bread is not unpalatable, though fearfully
indigestible, but the great drawback is that it is apt to get mouldy on
the smallest provocation, and after it has been made a few days
requires scraping and rebaking before it is possible to eat it.</p>
<p class="par">Then, as to the butchers&rsquo; meat, that is also a
vain dream. There is a tradition that once there was a butcher&rsquo;s
shop in the town, but this was in a time so long ago that even the
oldest inhabitant does not remember it. However, we are told that
perhaps some day we may get a wild boar, so we cheer ourselves with
this hope, and try to think the unvarying chickens are not so very thin
nor so very tough, after all. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">STORM-CLOUDS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">After blowing another hurricane all night there is
this morning a decided improvement in the weather. The wind has gone
down nearly as suddenly as it rose, though the sea is still running
very high.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the old wooden houses towards the outskirts of
the town, where they were more exposed to the violence of the storm,
have suffered considerable damage, and two have literally been blown
down. Happily, the inhabitants were able to escape in time, and no
lives have been lost.</p>
<p class="par">As I was anxious to make some sketches before being
prevented by our own departure, or by some of the prettiest houses
tumbling into ruins, we went early on shore on a drawing expedition;
but amongst so many picturesque spots, it was quite an <i>embarras
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>de richesses</i> to know where to begin. At last
I set to work upon a narrow street with dark-brown houses, whose
overhanging eaves almost touched their opposite neighbours.</p>
<p class="par">How I longed to have the skill of a really good artist,
especially to draw one low projecting window which the leafy branches
of a vine had formed into a little arch. A stray sunbeam was gleaming
brightly on two fair young faces as they peeped shyly at the strangers
through the framework of the tender green leaves. It was difficult to
decide which shone brightest in the dark street, the bright eyes or the
bright sunshine.</p>
<p class="par">With this charming exception the place had seemed
deserted when the sketch began, but after a few strokes had been made
sundry little groups appeared at the doors, and emboldened by our
pretending to take no notice, they gradually approached. Some of the
older women ventured at last to look over my shoulder to see what I was
about, and, when house after house appeared on the paper, their delight
could no longer be controlled, and they eagerly called the owners to
see the wonderful production. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Having accomplished the houses as well as I could, I
wanted some figures to complete the little picture, and tried to sketch
in as rapidly as possible a group of pretty girls who stood near. But
this was going too far, and was too great a tax on their courage. They
fled instantly; for so great is their dread of the <i>evil eye</i> that
they, no doubt, felt persuaded that, were they to allow their likeness
to be taken by a stranger, it would entail certain misery upon them. In
southern countries one must carefully avoid noticing young people too
much, and must especially beware of praising little children. A mother
would think it most cruel <i>kindness</i>, as it would be directly
casting the <i>jettatura</i> upon her child.</p>
<p class="par">In many parts of Calabria (the stronghold of this
superstition) it does not do for a friend, if a foreigner, to say a
word even in favour of that generally-praised member of the family, the
baby. Like the women of a Turkish harem, the children of a Christian
household are too sacred to be mentioned.</p>
<p class="par">Although they ran away, I was glad to find my Sinope
friends were not irrevocably offended, for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>they
turned up again when I began the next sketch. They gathered close
round, evidently much interested in me and my doings, but though there
was so much interest, there was not the least rudeness. It is to be
feared that a strange artist, in a foreign costume, would not meet with
such good-natured forbearance in an English village.</p>
<p class="par">I was examined critically, however, and I could
understand enough of what they were saying to know they were remarking
upon my nose, eyes, mouth, hair, dress, &amp;c. They were evidently
much puzzled as to the use of the little hood belonging to my cloak,
lifting it up, and making numerous interrogative signs; at last they
arrived, I am certain, at the conclusion that it served to carry bread
or babies in.</p>
<p class="par">When the drawing was finished, a nice, fresh-looking old
woman, a greater person probably than all the rest, as she wore some
very large coins round her neck, came out of the crowd, seized my hand,
kissed it several times, and then, tucking it tightly under her arm and
pointing to the public baths close by, tried to pull me towards them.
Whether she wished me to sketch them, or whether, in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>excess of her good-will, she wished to present
me to the rest of &ldquo;the world of Sinope&rdquo; (for in these parts
the bath is the women&rsquo;s club, where they meet to drink coffee and
sherbet, and talk over each other&rsquo;s affairs), must for ever
remain a mystery, for though we both talked, we neither understood. She
bowed persuasively, I bowed negatively, and clung tightly to my
companion, for I was really afraid, from the excess of kind friendship,
of being carried off against my will. At length, finding I was not to
be moved either morally or physically, she again repeatedly kissed my
hand, and with many smiles and friendly looks we parted.</p>
<p class="par">We then strolled on as far as the Turkish burial-ground,
enjoying the bright sunshine and the fresh air, for though so rough and
stormy at sea, on shore it was very pleasant. Beyond the cemetery is an
open common that extends to the edge of the cliffs that line the bay
opposite to that where the yacht is lying.</p>
<p class="par">Out at sea everything looked wild and desolate. Great
leaden-coloured waves were beating in angry foam against the rocks; not
a sail was to be seen; a few gulls were slowly flapping across the
dreary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>waste of water, their hoarse cries sounding as
if they too were uttering harsh warnings of coming disasters and death.
But what a curious contrast as we turned from so eerie a scene and
looked towards the town! On this side the sun was shining brightly, the
birds were singing in the bushes close by, whilst several groups of
Turkish women, seated under the cypress trees near the cemetery, made
the scene gay with their many-coloured ferighies.</p>
<p class="par">Turning inland, the day was so warm that we were glad to
sit down on an old wall under the shade of a leafy fig-tree, though,
when facing the sea, the keen, sharp wind had made us draw our cloaks
closely round us. Such is essentially the climate of Sinope, summer and
winter at the same time. No wonder, therefore, that the scourge of the
place is consumption. The consul tells us that spring and autumn are
nearly nominal seasons. The hot days of summer send the snow away, and
when they again begin to decline rain and winter come together. The sun
rules the temperature completely; when he shines the days are hot, even
in mid-winter, and again in summer, should he withdraw his rays, and
leave the sky gloomy and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>cloud-covered, there is a sudden
chill in the air that is far more injurious to health than the actual
cold of winter.</p>
<p class="par">It was not until the 2nd of October that the weather
cleared sufficiently to enable us to leave Sinope. Then, however, all
promised well for a prosperous voyage. With a clear, blue sky, calm
sea, and a fairly favourable breeze we set sail for the Bosphorus. For
twenty-four hours the yacht dashed gaily along; and we were all merry
with the anticipation of being speedily with our friends at Therapia,
when a sudden change came over the sunny prospect. A little cloud, no
bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand, was seen to windward. Though the sky
was still blue, the sea calm, and the sun shining brightly, the glass
went down with alarming rapidity. Suddenly the wind began to moan with
a wild melancholy wail, a great darkness rapidly spread over sea and
sky, except along the horizon; there a pallid streak of light showed
where the storm was stalking on, lashing the sea into a perfect whirl
of foam as it tore its way over the water. On came the squall with
wondrous quickness. There was nothing to be done but to make the best
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>of our way back to Sinope Bay, as it was evident
that ugly weather was again threatening.</p>
<p class="par">In less than an hour from the time when the little cloud
had been first perceived the yacht was running before a heavy sea with
scarcely a bit of canvas on her, but before night we rounded the
promontory off Sinope, and were at once in smooth water.</p>
<p class="par">Instead of returning, however, to our old anchorage, we
put in to Ghirgeh, a little town on the other side of the bay, where,
it was said, excellent shooting and good provisions were to be had.
Unluckily, landing is a work of difficulty should there be any sea, or
even swell, for there is a reef of rocks close to the shore that can
only be crossed in tolerably smooth water.</p>
<p class="par">The storm was not of long duration, though it was fierce
while it lasted. It raged all night with much violence, but the
following morning all things again looked propitious.</p>
<p class="par">The breeze, though it blew rather fresh, was fair for
the Bosphorus; we were getting impatient at so much delay. We might
have remained days at Ghirgeh without being able to land, for with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>wind from this quarter the surf beat heavily on
the reef, and the boat that had been sent on shore in search of
provisions had returned half full of water, with the men drenched to
the skin.</p>
<p class="par">Game and meat were also found to be &ldquo;myths,&rdquo;
and as the people on shore declared the gale was now well over, once
again we set sail for Constantinople.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Those who go down to the sea in ships, these men
see the works of The Lord, and His wonders in the great
deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">We thank Him who stills the raging sea, that in His
mercy He has guarded us through so fearful a tempest.</p>
<p class="par">We had left Ghirgeh on Tuesday. Late on Wednesday
afternoon once more the warning glass fell rapidly, and the breeze that
had been fresh and steady suddenly dropped. Towards evening we were
almost becalmed, little puffs of hot air only occasionally fanning us
as the yacht rose slowly on the heaving sea. But about one
o&rsquo;clock that night, the gale came upon us with all its force,
preceded by an icy wind that seemed to freeze the ropes into bits of
iron. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">No sooner was the roar of the mighty tempest heard
across the waters than the sea, lashed into madness by the tremendous
force of the wind, turned into a seething cauldron. In an instant the
great waves rose up foaming, and tossed and dashed against the poor
little vessel as if resolved on its destruction. As the storm raged
across her the dear <i>Claymore</i> heeled over, and quivered as if she
had received a blow, but righting herself immediately, she gallantly
faced her foe and prepared for another shock. Speedily it
came&mdash;and again another, and another. More and more furious became
the wind, and though the foresail had been reefed, and we had only the
storm-jib, it was necessary to furl them both and take in the jib-boom;
but in vain the men pulled and strained, the ropes were frozen.
Servants, cooks, every man on board was summoned, Mr. Harvey, Captain
Martini, and Charlie cheering on the men, as they too sprang forward to
the ropes; but crash after crash came the great waves, as they raged
against the yacht with a fury that it seemed almost impossible anything
of wood and iron could long withstand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At length Charlie and another man, with their knives
between their teeth, crawled on to the bowsprit, though every plunge
buried them deep in the waves, and succeeded in severing the ropes that
held the sail. Relieved from the too great pressure, the little vessel
rose more easily, and we heard a voice say cheerfully, &ldquo;We shall
do now.&rdquo; It was of course impossible to be on deck, but my
sister, Mademoiselle G., and I remained crouched on the staircase
listening in intense anxiety to the turmoil. When the sail was at last
taken in I went down to the children, fearing they would be frightened,
but the little creatures had gone to sleep before the gale began, and
neither storm nor wind awakened them. It was difficult to stay by them.
Exaggerating probably the danger we were in, their lovely, quiet sleep
quite unnerved one; so, as it was better to do rather than to think, we
busied ourselves as much as possible in making hot tea for those on
deck, though even this little task was a work of difficulty, so
violently were we thrown from side to side. Occasionally during the
night one of us crept up the companion and ventured a hurried look-out.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">People have written much about the majestic beauty of a
storm. To me it was simply <i>horrible</i>. In the distracting rush and
confusion, it seemed as if the elements, seized with hideous rage, were
tearing and rending each other like infuriated animals. I looked on
with the shuddering horror one would feel if standing between wild
beasts who were preparing to spring at each other&rsquo;s throats. When
holding fast by the sides of the companion I ventured a hurried glance
upwards. My heart seemed for a moment to stand still, as I saw a huge
black mass, rather than a wave of water, towering high above us. So
monstrous, so steep did it seem, that until one felt the vessel rising,
it seemed impossible that anything framed by man could surmount so
precipitous a wall. Piles of foam rose still higher in the air, which
was filled with a pale, ghastly light when the moon showed herself
occasionally between the great heavy banks of clouds, as if afraid to
look fully forth on such a weird scene of chaos and confusion. But
worse even than the sight was the overpowering noise&mdash;the uproar.
Instead of diminishing as day began to dawn the rush and the roar
deepened, until the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301"
name="pb301">301</a>]</span>senses seemed carried away by the mighty
clamour, and the brain seemed to whirl, as if it also was the sport of
the tremendous wind. Everything was crashing, first on one side, then
on the other.</p>
<p class="par">In the midst of this wild turmoil a deep unearthly sound
rang through the vessel&mdash;the slow, heavy toll of a bell that
seemed to come from beneath the sea. For a moment our crew, all
Italians, but as brave a set of men as ever trod a deck, seemed
paralyzed. Again the warning sound pealed forth; several fell on their
knees on receiving as they believed so direct an intimation of our
fate.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Harvey and the captain rushed below, for it was
absolutely necessary to ascertain the cause. Happily in their anxious
search the ominous sound was again heard as they passed through the
galley. Two very large copper pans had got loose, and when the vessel
rolled heavily one way, they struck against each other, and the blow
produced the solemn clang that had appeared so terrific. Fortunately,
therefore, the dark omen became a cause of merriment to our
superstitious but light-hearted sailors. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Many a ghost-story, probably, has quite as prosaic an
origin.</p>
<p class="par">Before the gale began the evening had been oppressively
warm; my window on deck had, therefore, been opened. In the hurry and
confusion that ensued when the squall came on, it had been closed, but
not securely fastened, and I was suddenly and most disagreeably
reminded of the omission. Quite worn out with fatigue and anxiety, I
had gone to my cabin to lie down for half an hour, when the yacht made
an unusually heavy plunge, and the window burst open, just as a
cataract of spray and water poured over the deck. Down came a torrent
into my cabin, destroying in a minute all the freshness and coquetry of
the pretty lace curtains and pink ribbons, and giving me and all my
belongings a thorough bath. A more unpleasant sensation can scarcely be
imagined, though a few months&rsquo; yachting gives one a miserable
equanimity about spoiling clothes. Sometimes when a very favourite
garment is found covered with a verdant coating of green mould, a few
indignant remarks are made upon <i>sea-damp</i>; but, generally
speaking, any little spirit on the subject, any little vanity is early
crushed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>and one remains calm in mind and shabby in
person to the end of the voyage.</p>
<p class="par">Towards mid-day on Thursday the gale broke a little,
that is to say, there were longer intervals between the squalls, but it
was an anxious time, for we were off Cape Karempi, and the most
dangerous part of the Black Sea navigation lies between this point and
Cape Aia on the northern coast. Nearly half the wrecks take place near
this cape. The currents are numerous and very strong, and for more than
a hundred miles not a harbour nor place of refuge is to be found. Alas!
for the luckless vessel which may be driven too near these cruel rocks!
Little hope for her in a northerly gale, should this iron-bound coast,
with its miles of foaming breakers, come in sight.</p>
<p class="par">Many were the anxious inquiries we made as to our
position with reference to this dreaded cape. Happily, we had every
reason to believe that we were well out to sea, and the vessel now
lay-to, without shipping a drop of water.</p>
<p class="par">Although worn out with fatigue, it was impossible to
sleep all Thursday night, so tremendous was the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>rolling. We were quite black and blue from the
bruises we had in consequence of being so tossed from side to side in
our cots.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday morning both sea and wind became more
moderate, and for many hours we slept the sound sleep of the tired. In
the afternoon we bethought ourselves of our unfortunate menagerie, and
went to see how the poor creatures had fared during the storm.</p>
<p class="par">The unlucky geese had been the greatest sufferers.
Little they thought when they left the peaceful farmyard at Karani of
what was in store for them. The water had been so constantly over the
fore part of the vessel, and the cold had been so great, that the men
had good-naturedly taken the poor things to the forecastle.</p>
<p class="par">One luckless goose, however, either from fright or from
having imprudently committed a slight excess in drinking half a bottle
of turpentine, had been seized with fits, and remained in an alarming
state for many hours. We were much grieved, thinking her last moment
had come, for she was lying on her back, feebly kicking in a deplorable
fashion, when, with a supreme effort, she dragged herself into the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>coal-hole, and convulsively began to swallow
some bits of coal.</p>
<p class="par">We left in sadness, thinking this could only be the last
expiring struggle; but an hour later we received a bulletin to say the
patient was not only alive, but better, and in the evening she was
pronounced convalescent, her remedy having proved most effectual.</p>
<p class="par">However, between the fits and the coals, our friend
presents a lamentable spectacle: the fits have caused her wings to
twist inside out, and the coals have given her such a sooty tinge, that
not a trace remains of her once beautiful snowy plumage.</p>
<p class="par">We hear that many a candle has been vowed by the men to
their favourite shrines. They have behaved admirably; but few of them
had ever been in the Black Sea, and none had seen a storm there
before.</p>
<p class="par">Even the imperturbable Charlie says he has never known
an &ldquo;uglier&rdquo; gale. The crew&rsquo;s admiration of the
behaviour of the <i>Claymore</i> is quite unbounded; they cannot praise
her enough. She has certainly weathered the storm gallantly, and has
come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>gloriously out of the combat, without having
sustained any injury to speak of&mdash;only a rope or two gone and a
block broken.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday morning we were safely anchored off the
Water Gate in Sevastopol harbour, and remained there a few days to
recruit our somewhat exhausted strength.</p>
<p class="par">Each day brought sad accounts of the numerous wrecks
that had taken place in this storm, the most severe that has been known
for years.</p>
<p class="par">Amongst other catastrophes, it gave us a great shock to
hear of the total loss of the Persian emigrant steamer that we had seen
at Sinope. She went down very suddenly early on Thursday morning. A
mate and three seamen clung to a spar, were picked up, and brought to
Kamiesch. Every other soul on board perished. The men say the vessel
was leaky and overladen. It was frightful to think that all those poor
creatures we had seen only a few days ago had met with so terrible an
end.</p>
<p class="par">The papers are full of the disasters that have taken
place.</p>
<p class="par">Before entering the Bosphorus we met the English
man-of-war kindly sent by our friends at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>Constantinople in
search of us, for our lengthened absence and the tremendous gale had
alarmed them for our safety.</p>
<p class="par">The next day we were at Therapia, perfectly happy, not
only in the rest of so charming a haven, but in being once more with
most dear and valued friends.</p>

well-written, and instructive.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;These volumes will place Mr. Dixon
permanently on the roll of English authors who have rendered their
country a service, by his putting on record a truthful and brilliant
account of that most popular and instructive relic of antiquity.
&lsquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s Tower;&rsquo; the annals of which, as
related in these volumes, are by turns exciting and amusing, while they
never fail to interest. Our ancient stronghold could have had no better
historian than Mr. Dixon.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Post.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;By his merits of literary execution, his
vivacious portraitures of historical figures, his masterly powers of
narrative and description, and the force and graceful ease of his
style, Mr. Dixon will keep his hold upon a multitude of
readers.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Illustrated News.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;These volumes are two galleries of
richly painted portraits of the noblest men and most brilliant women,
besides others commemorated by English history. The grand old Royal
Keep, palace and prison by turns, is revivified in these volumes, which
close the narrative, extending from the era of Sir John Eliot, who saw
Raleigh die in Palace Yard, to that of Thistlewood, the last prisoner
immured in the Tower. Few works are given to us, in these days, so
abundant in originality and research as Mr.
Dixon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The most brilliant and fascinating of
Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s literary achievements.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sun.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Dixon has accomplished his task
well. Few subjects of higher and more general interest than the Tower
could have been found. Around the old pile clings all that is most
romantic in our history. To have made himself the trusted and accepted
historian of the Tower is a task on which a writer of highest
reputation may well be proud. This Mr. Dixon has done. He has,
moreover, adapted his work to all classes. To the historical student it
presents the result of long and successful research in sources
undiscovered till now; to the artist it gives the most glowing picture
yet, perhaps, produced of the more exciting scenes of national history;
to the general reader it offers fact with all the graces of fiction.
Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s book is admirable alike for the general view of
history it presents, and for the beauty and value of its single
pictures.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sunday Times.</i> <span class=

as we have reason to know pleasantly familiar, to our readers. To them
a large portion of the contents of the volume are well known in the

appeared in our columns. In the continuous shape in which they are now
presented, with the gaps filled up by the insertion in the proper place
of letters which arrived too late for publication, they will not, we
believe, be less acceptable. Of the characteristic of these letters it
is not for us to speak. The unprecedented interest which they excited
as they appeared, and the demand for their republication which has been
urged from many quarters, are a better criticism than any which it
would be becoming in us to offer. We will only add that, in its

of invasion rolled over the land. Years must pass before it will be
possible for any to see Fair France as our author was privileged to see

Hepworth Dixon</span>, Author of &ldquo;New America,&rdquo; &ldquo;Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Tower,&rdquo; &amp;c. <i>Third Edition.</i> 2 vols.
8vo, with Coloured Illustrations. 30s.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s book will be certain
not only to interest but to please its readers and it deserves to do
so. It contains a great deal that is worthy of attention, and is likely
to produce a very useful effect. The ignorance of the English people
with respect to Russia has long been so dense that we cannot avoid
being grateful to a writer who has taken the trouble to make personal
acquaintance with that seldom-visited land, and to bring before the
eyes of his countrymen a picture of its scenery and its people, which
is so novel and interesting that it can scarcely fail to arrest their
attention.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;We claim for Mr. Dixon the merit of
having treated his subject in a fresh and original manner. He has done
his best to see with his own eyes the vast country which he describes,
and he has visited some parts of the land with which few even among its
natives are familiar, and he has had the advantage of being brought
into personal contact with a number of those Russians whose opinions
are of most weight. The consequence is, that he has been able to lay
before general readers such a picture of Russia and the Russian people
as cannot fail to interest
them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Dixon has invented a good title for
his volumes on Russia. The chapter on Lomonosoff, the peasant poet, is
one of the best in the book, and the chapter on Kief is equally good.
He gives an interesting and highly picturesque account of the working
of the jury system in a case which he himself saw tried. The
descriptions of the peasant villages, and of the habits and manners of
the peasantry, are very good; in fact, the descriptions are excellent
throughout the work.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Dixon has succeeded in producing a
book which is at once highly valuable and eminently readable. In our
judgment it is superior to any work that has proceeded from Mr.
Dixon&rsquo;s pen, and we heartily recommend it to our readers. The
information he conveys is very great, his judgments are evidently the
result of much reflection, and his style is singularly forcible and
picturesque.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;We heartily commend these volumes to all
who wish either for instruction or
relaxation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;In these picturesque and fascinating
volumes, Mr. Dixon carries his readers over a wide range of country,
from the Arctic Sea to the southern slopes of the Ural range, from the
straits of Yenikale to the Gulf of Riga, and, by the force of brisk,
nervous and picturesque language, makes them realize the scenery,
manners, politics, poetry of every mile of ground over which he
conducts them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Free
Russia,&rsquo; is another valuable addition to the books of travel
which he has given us. It reveals to our view the great mysterious
people of Eastern Europe.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is a more important and remarkable
work upon the great Muscovite Empire than any foreign traveller has
ever even attempted, much less accomplished. Thanks to the writer of
these splendid volumes, &lsquo;Free Russia&rsquo; is brought clearly,
boldly, vividly, comprehensively, and yet minutely, within the ken of
every intelligent reading Englishman. The book is in many parts as
enthralling as a romance, besides being full of life and
character.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sun.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;&lsquo;Free Russia&rsquo; is one of the
most remarkable books that has ever been written in our times, of the
value of which it is impossible to speak in terms too highly
commendatory.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Messenger.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Dixon is delightfully readable.
&lsquo;Free Russia&rsquo; has afforded us a great deal of pleasure. It
is the best work of its clever and versatile

<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;From first to last this volume overflows

to illumine the darksome recesses of our national
story.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;We earnestly recommend this remarkable

a ripe scholar and an accomplished master of English diction, and a

clothes the gray stones of the old Tower with a new and more living

vigour and liveliness, and he would make a far duller subject than this

<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;We can highly recommend Mr.
Dixon&rsquo;s work. It will enhance his reputation. The whole is
charmingly written, and there is a life, a spirit, and a reality about
the sketches of the celebrated prisoners of the Tower, which give the
work the interest of a romance. &lsquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s Tower&rsquo;
is likely to become one of the most popular contributions to
history.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;In many respects this noble volume is
Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s masterpiece. The book is a microcosm of our English

more than sustains Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s reputation. It enhances
it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sun.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is a work of great value. It cannot
fail to be largely popular and to maintain its author&rsquo;s
reputation. It bears throughout the marks of careful study, keen
observation, and that power of seizing upon those points of a story
that are of real importance, which is the most precious possession of
the historian. To all historic documents, ancient and modern, Mr. Dixon
has had unequalled facilities of access, and his work will in future be
the trusted and popular history of the Tower. He has succeeded in
giving a splendid panorama of English
history.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par adReview"><span class="sc">From the
Times</span>:&mdash;&ldquo;All the civilized world&mdash;English,
Continental, and American&mdash;takes an interest in the Tower of
London. The Tower is the stage upon which has been enacted some of the
grandest dramas and saddest tragedies in our national annals. If, in
imagination, we take our stand on those time-worn walls, and let
century after century flit past us, we shall see in due succession the
majority of the most famous men and lovely women of England in the
olden time. We shall see them jesting, jousting, love-making, plotting,
and then anon, perhaps, commending their souls to God in the presence
of a hideous masked figure, bearing an axe in his hands. It is such
pictures as these that Mr. Dixon, with considerable skill as an
historical limner, has set before us in these volumes. Mr. Dixon dashes
off the scenes of Tower history with great spirit. His descriptions are
given with such terseness and vigour that we should spoil them by any
attempt at condensation. As favourable examples of his narrative powers
we may call attention to the story of the beautiful but unpopular
Elinor, Queen of Henry III., and the description of Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s
first and second arrivals at the Tower. Then we have the story of the
bold Bishop of Durham, who escapes by the aid of a cord hidden in a
wine jar; and the tale of Maud Fitzwalter, imprisoned and murdered by
the caitiff John. Passing onwards, we meet Charles of Orleans, the
poetic French Prince, captured at Agincourt, and detained for
five-and-twenty years a prisoner in the Tower. Next we encounter the
baleful form of Richard of Gloucester, and are filled with indignation
at the blackest of the black Tower deeds. As we draw nearer to modern
times, we have the sorrowful story of the Nine Days&rsquo; Queen, poor
little Lady Jane Grey. The chapter entitled &ldquo;No Cross, no
Crown&rdquo; is one of the most affecting in the book. A mature man can
scarcely read it without feeling the tears ready to trickle from his
eyes. No part of the first volume yields in interest to the chapters
which are devoted to the story of Sir Walter Raleigh. The greater part
of the second volume is occupied with the story of the Gunpowder Plot.
The narrative is extremely interesting, and will repay perusal. Another
<i lang="fr">cause cel&ecirc;bre</i> possessed of a perennial interest,
is the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury by Lord and Lady Somerset. Mr.
Dixon tells the tale skilfully. In conclusion, we may congratulate the
author on this, his latest work. Both volumes are decidedly attractive,
and throw much light on our national history, but we think the palm of
superior interest must be awarded to the second volume.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par adReview"><span class="sc">From the
Athen&aelig;um</span>:&mdash;&ldquo;The present volume is superior in
sustained interest to that by which it was preceded. The whole details
are so picturesquely narrated, that the reader is carried away by the
narrative. The stories are told with such knowledge of new facts as to
make them like hitherto unwritten chapters in our history.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par adReview"><span class="sc">From the Morning
Post</span>:&mdash;&ldquo;This volume fascinates the reader&rsquo;s
imagination and stimulates his curiosity, whilst throwing floods of
pure light on several of the most perplexing matters of James the
First&rsquo;s reign. Not inferior to any of the author&rsquo;s previous
works of history in respect of discernment and logical soundness, it
equals them in luminous expression, and surpasses some of them in
romantic interest.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href=

<p class="par">I.&mdash;SAM SLICK&rsquo;S NATURE AND HUMAN NATURE.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The first volume of Messrs. Hurst and
Blackett&rsquo;s Standard Library of Cheap Editions forms a very good
beginning to what will doubtless be a very successful undertaking.
&lsquo;Nature and Human Nature&rsquo; is one of the best of Sam
Slick&rsquo;s witty and humorous productions, and is well entitled to
the large circulation which it cannot fail to obtain in its present
convenient and cheap shape. The volume combines with the great
recommendations of a clear, bold type, and good paper, the lesser but
attractive merits of being well illustrated and elegantly
bound.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Post.</i></p>
<p class="par">II.&mdash;JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is a very good and a very
interesting work. It is designed to trace the career from boyhood to
age of a perfect man&mdash;a Christian gentleman; and it abounds in
incident both well and highly wrought. Throughout it is conceived in a
high spirit, and written with great ability. This cheap and handsome
new edition is worthy to pass freely from hand to hand as a gift book
in many households.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The new and cheaper edition of this
interesting work will doubtless meet with great success. John Halifax,
the hero of this most beautiful story, is no ordinary hero, and this
his history is no ordinary book. It is a full-length portrait of a true
gentleman, one of nature&rsquo;s own nobility. It is also the history
of a home, and a thoroughly English one. The work abounds in incident,
and is full of graphic power and true pathos. It is a book that few
will read without becoming wiser and
better.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>
<p class="par">III.&mdash;THE CRESCENT AND THE CROSS.</p>
<p class="par">BY ELIOT WARBURTON.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Independent of its value as an original
narrative, and its useful and interesting information, this work is
remarkable for the colouring power and play of fancy with which its
descriptions are enlivened. Among its greatest and most lasting charms
is its reverent and serious spirit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Quarterly
Review.</i></p>
<p class="par">IV.&mdash;NATHALIE. By JULIA KAVANAGH.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;&lsquo;Nathalie&rsquo; is Miss
Kavanagh&rsquo;s best imaginative effort. Its manner is gracious and
attractive. Its matter is good. A sentiment, a tenderness, are

thank the author for means of doing
so.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<p class="par">VI.&mdash;ADAM GRAEME. By MRS. OLIPHANT.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;A story awakening genuine emotions of
interest and delight by its admirable pictures of Scottish life and
scenery. The author sets before us the essential attributes of
Christian virtue, their deep and silent workings in the heart, and
their beautiful manifestations in life, with a delicacy, power, and
truth which can hardly be surpassed.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Post<span class=

as long as that of Scott&rsquo;s or Bulwer&rsquo;s Novels. Its
remarkable originality and happy descriptions of American life still

THE LAST FOUR POPES.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;A picturesque book on Rome and its
ecclesiastical sovereigns, by an eloquent Roman Catholic. Cardinal
Wiseman has treated a special subject with so much geniality, that his
recollections will excite no ill-feeling in those who are most
conscientiously opposed to every idea of human infallibility
represented in Papal

<p class="par">XII.&mdash;THE OLD JUDGE. By SAM SLICK.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The publications included in this
Library have all been of good quality; many give information while they
entertain, and of that class the book before us is a specimen. The
manner in which the Cheap Editions forming the series is produced,
deserves especial mention. The paper and print are unexceptionable;
